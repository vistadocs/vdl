Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic

pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system. Below is a list of all the

applications involved in this project along with their patch number:

APPLICATION/VERSION PATCH

--------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0 PSO\*7\*358

INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0 IB\*2\*434

ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0 BPS\*1\*9

This specific patch contains functionality for the following:

patch, the API call is \$\$RX^IBNCPDP. One of the purposes of this API

a TRICARE eligible patient who has an inpatient status in VistA as of

the prescription issue date, then the prescription will NOT be ECME

billable.

2\. In the case described above, the prescription will be marked in

Claims Tracking as non-billable with a Reason Not Billable of "TRICARE

INPATIENT/DISCHARGE".

3\. Minor corrections are being made to the field descriptions for 2

fields in the IB NCPDP EVENT LOG file (#366.14).

## Pre/Post Installation Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The post-installation routine is IBY434PO. This routine will add a new

entry into the CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE REASONS file (#356.8). The

new entry will be "TRICARE INPATIENT/DISCHARGE" with non-billable reason

CODE (the .04 field of file \#356.8) of "RX16".

The post-installation routine is automatically deleted by KIDS if allowed

by your local Kernel parameters configuration.

## Installation Instructions

CMOP transmissions occur.
