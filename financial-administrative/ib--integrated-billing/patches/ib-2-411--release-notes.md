Description:

===========

This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans

Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic

pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system. Below is a list of all the

applications involved in this project along with their patch number:

APPLICATION/VERSION PATCH

--------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0 PSO\*7\*290

INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0 IB\*2\*411

ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0 BPS\*1\*8

The three patches (PSO\*7\*290, IB\*2\*411 and BPS\*1\*8) are being released in

the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build

distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 4.0. For more specific instructions please

refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.

This patch modifies the Integrated Billing v2.0 application as described

below:

1\. Third Party Joint Inquiry (TPJI),

Receipt Processing and Decrease Adjustment

-------------------------------------------------

This patch modifies the lookup of ePharmacy transactions to display

additional information to assist in the bill selection. When a lookup for

a bill is done and multiple matches are found the insurance company name

and a Coordination of Benefits (COB) indicator will now be displayed.

Select one of the following:

BILL RX DATE INSURANCE COB PATIENT

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1 K60008Pe 100714 07/16/07 AETNA INSURANCE p IBPATIENT,ONE

2 K60008Qe 100714 07/16/07 BLUE CROSS OF WY s IBPATIENT,ONE

3 K60008Re 100714 07/16/07 NEW YORK LIFE IN IBPATIENT,ONE

Select one of the bills by number:

2\. Changes to support ePharmacy secondary billing

-------------------------------------------------

Electronic Claims Management Engine package was modified to allow the user

to submit an e-claim to secondary payers. IB software was modified to

support secondary billing for e-Pharmacy claims, to create secondary bills

for specific insurance plans and rate types. Note: the Claims Tracking

system is not updated with the results of secondary billing except in

cases where the primary payer rejects the claim, but the secondary payer

pays.

3\. Changes to IB ECME EVENTS report

-----------------------------------

IB ECME EVENTS report was modified to capture, store and display RX COB

(payer sequence) indicators.

4\. BILLINFO^IBNCPDPI API modification

-------------------------------------

In order to support a new secondary billing functionality for e-Pharmacy

the IB Application Programmer Interface (API) BILLINFO^IBNCPDPI (ICR

\#4729) was modified to accept a new parameter to pass in the payer

sequence to return information for a specific bill - primary or secondary.

5\. RNB^IBNCPDPI API addition

----------------------------

In order to provide additional billing functionality for e-Pharmacy, the

IB API RNB^IBNCPDPI (ICR# 4729) was created to provide information

about whether or not the Claims Tracking episode for a specific

Prescription and Fill is billable.

6\. New APIs for e-Pharmacy

--------------------------

In order to support a new secondary billing functionality for e-Pharmacy

three new APIs were introduced (ICR \# 5355) in this patch: ISBILL^IBNCPUT3

\- to determine if there is a bill with a given bill \#, BILINF^IBNCPUT3 -

to get bill details from file \#399, RXBILL^IBNCPUT3 - to find bill(s) for

the specific RX/refill.

7\. A new IB API to support ECME Potential Secondary Rx Claims Report

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The COLLECT^IBOSRX API (ICR \# 5361) was designed to collect IB data for

ECME Potential Secondary Rx Claims Report.

8\. The bill matching functionality

----------------------------------

The code responsible for bill matching was adjusted to correctly process

bills with different payer sequence (primary and secondary bills). Also

modifications have been made to unify the matching process and use 7

digit format with leading zeros for ECME number identifiers (BCID).

The post-install routine will loop through all ECME number identifiers and

make sure they are 7 characters long.

9\. Removing non-standard cross-references

-----------------------------------------

The software was modified so that the non-standard "AG" cross-references

of the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) are no longer used. The post-install

routine will clean up the "AG" node of the file, removing part of the

non-FileMan standard cross-references.

10\. New Action in Patient Insurance Management

----------------------------------------------

A new ListManager action has been added to the Patient Insurance

Management screen to allow the user to quickly identify which of the

patient's insurance policies provide for pharmacy coverage as of a user

specified prescription fill date. The name of the new action is "RX COB

Determination".

This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):

There is no NSR associated with this patch.

first available FTP server.

2\. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a

specific server as follows:

Albany REDACTED

Post Installation Overview

--------------------------

The IB post-install routine delivered with IB\*2\*411 will schedule a job to

run in 3 days which removes invalid cross references. The three days

allows additional processing time to eliminate any remaining dependencies

on the old cross references.

It is important that the post install routine IB20P411 NOT be deleted

prior to the running of the background tasked job. At the completion of

the background tasked job, the installer will receive a MailMan message

indicating the post install routine may be removed from the site's system.

================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================

To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed when users are

not on the system and during non-peak hours. Of particular concern would

be the items below.

1\. Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated

by the BPS Nightly Background Job option \[BPS NIGHTLY

BACKGROUND JOB\]. Wait for this job to finish or complete the

installation before this job starts.

2\. Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being

transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish

or complete the installation before the transmission starts.

CMOP transmissions occur.

3\. In addition, note that you will be prompted to disable the

following options during the installation:
