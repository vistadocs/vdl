The PCE Standardization 1.0 project addresses the lack of standardized data in PCE which is a barrier to important areas including: interoperability, clinical decision support, and quality reporting.

# Purpose

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To take full advantage of the standardization, changes to VistA applications that use PCE data are required. These applications include Clinical Reminders and Health Summary. To make it easier for sites, the builds for PCE (PX\*1.0\*211), Clinical Reminders (PXRM\*2.0\*42), Health Summary (GMTS\*2.7\*122), Problem List (GMPL\*2.0\*53), and Order Entry/Results Reporting (OR\*3.0\*501) are being distributed in a multi-package build named PCE STANDARDIZATION 1.0. These Release Notes describe enhancements and modifications implemented in the PCE Standardization release.

# Audience

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The intended audience for this document is the facility administrative and clinical personnel who are users of Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) PCE, Problem List and CPRS applications.

# This Release

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following sections provide a summary of the new features and functions added, enhancements and modifications to the existing software, and any known issue for PCE Standardization 1.0.

## New Features Added

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

None.

## Enhancements and Modifications to Existing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Standardization of immunizations and skin tests was addressed by the VistA Immunization Enhancements (VIMM) project. The goal of this project is, to the extent possible, to standardize the legacy data in Education Topics, Exams, and Health Factors and to introduce a new V file for capturing standardized codes other than International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) will be the first coding system supported by the new V-file. The ability to use a richer set of standardized codes should reduce the need to create new non-standard data types, especially health factors.

The enhancements and modifications in this document apply to the following builds:

- PCE PX\*1.0\*211
- Clinical Reminders PXRM\*2.0\*42
- Health Summary GMTS\*2.7\*122
- Problem List GMPL\*2.0\*53
- Order Entry/Results Reporting OR\*3.0\*501

### PCE PX\*1.0\*211

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

First, some terminology will facilitate this discussion. If an Education Topic, Exam, or Health Factor is mapped to a standard code, an entry made in the V STANDARD CODES file (#9000010.71) as a result of this mapping will be referred to as a mapped source entry (MSE).

All the V-files have an Event Date and Time field that can be used to record when the action related to the specific V-file entry was done. Although this field has always been present in PCE, it has never really been used. To provide a more accurate patient record, a number of changes have been made to capture Event Date and Time. If, for some reason, Event Date and Time has not been recorded, then Visit/Admit Date &Time will be used instead. But, in any case, we will refer to it as Event Date and Time.

The modifications and enhancements for the following functionalities are described next:

1.  PCE Data Element Creation and Editing
2.  PCE List Manager Encounter Edit and Display
3.  PCE Parameters file \#815
4.  PCE Reports
5.  Mapped Codes
6.  PXK Visit Data Event Protocol
7.  Clinical Reminders Index
8.  V-File APIs

#### PCE Data Element Creation and Editing

The following fields were added to the EDUCATION TOPICS file (#9999999.09), EXAM file (#9999999.15), and the HEALTH FACTORS file (#9999999.64) :

Class is a set of codes that can have a value of National, VISN, or Local. This field replaces the outdated and broken mechanism of designating an entry as national based on its IEN. Data elements whose Class is national cannot be edited by sites.

Sponsor is a pointer to the REMINDER SPONSOR file (#811.6). It provides a way to designate who is responsible for the content of the data element.

Change Log is a multiple that records the user who made changes and when they were made. The user can also add additional information in a word-processing field.

Print Name is used to store a mixed case “user friendly” name for the content. It will be used instead of the Name field in Clinical Reminders maintenance output and Health Summary output. Education Topics already had a Print Name field, but its maximum length was 30 characters. The length was increased to 64 to be consistent with Exams and Health Factors. When PX\*1.0\*211 is installed, for all data elements that do not already have a Print Name, the post-installation process will generate a Print Name using the .01 field of the data element. These generated Print Names provide a starting place and may not always be optimal, in which case, sites can edit the name if they have a class of Local.

Description is a word-processing field; it is used to describe the use and purpose of the data element.

The Code Mappings multiple provides a mechanism to link a data element to standard codes such as a SNOMED CT code. Mapping a data element makes it equivalent to the standard code. If mapping is not done correctly, it will cause data quality problems and possible patient safety issues. Therefore, only national data elements can be mapped and the ability to map is restricted to holders of the key: PX CODE MAPPING.

For data elements that have an associated measurement, the set of fields Minimum Value, Maximum Value, and Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) Code define the allowed range for the magnitude and the unit of the measurement.

To store a measurement Magnitude and UCUM Code, fields were added to the Education Topic, Exam, and Health Factor V-files.

The V Standard Codes file was added. To start with, SNOMED CT codes added to an encounter are stored here. Also, all codes that are added to an encounter as a result of code mapping are stored in this file. This includes CPT and ICD codes.

New management systems were created for Education Topics, Exams, and Health Factors. These are integrated systems that use List Manager to list all the data elements and the actions for managing them. When adding or editing a data element, FileMan’s ScreenMan functionality is used.

To make it easier to differentiate between Category and Factor health factors, the .01 field of a category health factor must end with “\[C\]”. If the user does not add the “\[C\],” it will be appended automatically. When a category is created, only an abbreviated list of health factor fields needs to be populated. Therefore, there is a ScreenMan form for categories and another one for factors. In the past, it was possible to convert a category to a factor, but this created problems if there were any factors in the category. Now it is no longer possible to convert a category to a factor.

#### PCE List Manager Encounter Edit and Display

Many changes were made to this functionality; the largest one was the addition of V Standard Codes. Any V Standard Codes entries that are part of the encounter are now displayed and V Standard Codes entries can be added and edited.

The ability to add/edit Event Date/Time and measurement was added.

The input method for Event Date and Time has been standardized. If the user types “??” at the prompt, descriptive help will be displayed. The help text is the data dictionary description of the Event Date and Time field from the V-file the user is putting data into, for example V Health Factors or V POV. Accordingly, the Descriptions and in some cases Technical Descriptions were updated.

Table 1: Descriptions and Technical Descriptions that got updated

| V-file       | Fields          | Description | Technical Description |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Visit            | .01                 | Updated         | Not Updated               |
| V CPT            | Event Date and Time | Updated         | Updated                   |
| V Exam           | Event Date and Time | Updated         | Updated                   |
| V Health Factors | Event Date and Time | Updated         | Updated                   |
| V PATIENT ED     | Event Date and Time | Updated         | Updated                   |
| V POV            | Event Date and Time | Updated         | Updated                   |
| V POV            | Date of Injury      | Updated         | Not Updated               |
| V Provider       | Event Date and Time | Updated         | Updated                   |
| V Standard Codes | Event Date and Time | Updated         | Updated                   |

In V POV, there is the concept of an injury code. For ICD-9, these are codes in the range 800-999.9. For ICD-10, a code is an injury code if it starts with the letter S or T. If the code is an injury code, the user is prompted to enter the Date of Injury. Input of the Date of Injury was changed to use the same mechanism as Event Date and Time as described above.

The PCE Workgroup made the determination that editing the .01 of a V-file entry should be treated as a deletion and therefore editing of the .01 is no longer allowed. If the .01 is incorrect, then the entry needs to be deleted. Editing of fields other than the .01 is still allowed.

If an Education Topic, Exam, or Health Factor is added to an encounter and it has a mapped code, the corresponding mapped source entry (MSE) in V Standard Codes will be created and be visible on the encounter. An MSE cannot be edited.

When adding CPT and ICD codes to an encounter, the code lookup is now done through a Lexicon search, consistent with the lookup for V Standard Codes. The user enters a search term, which can be text, such as diabetes, a partial code, or even an exact code. The user is then prompted for the Event Date and Time. If the Event Date and Time is not entered, the Visit/Admit Date &Time will be used in its place. The search term and the Event Date and Time are then passed to Lexicon and a list of codes matching the search term that are active as of the Event Date and Time are returned. If an appropriate code is found on the list and selected by the users, it is added to the encounter.

An existing bug was found where ICD codes were not filing in the List Manager interface. The bug was corrected.

The routine in the List Manager interface that displays the coding system type (ICD-9 or ICD-10) for an ICD diagnosis code was using the Visit Date to determine the coding system type. This was changed to determine the coding system type directly from the code itself.

The PCE Workgroup decided that that capture of Event Date and Time should be allowed for V Provider.

At the direction of the VistA Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) business owner, adding/editing of ICD diagnosis codes was removed from the List Manager interface for Immunizations and Skin Tests.

For V CPT, V POV, and V Standard Codes, the Event Date and Time is used in the Lexicon search so only codes active as of the Event Date and Time are on the selection list. Because of this, the Event Date and Time cannot be edited for these types of entries. However for Education Topics, Exams, and Health Factors, the Event Date and Time can be edited. If a value has already been stored, it will be used as the default if the field is selected for editing.

#### PCE Parameters file \#815

The Management Mail Group field, which is a pointer to the Mail Group file \#3.8, was added. Members of this mail group will receive MailMan messages related to the management of PCE. An example is the message that is delivered when linking of a mapped code has completed. This field can be edited using the option PX SITE PARAMETERS EDIT or with FileMan enter/edit.

The Site Support Contacts multiple was also added. When DATA2PCE error messages are displayed to a CPRS user, they may be too technical for the user to understand. The error message will refer them to the contacts on this list. The list can be edited using FileMan enter/edit.

#### PCE Reports

The Reminders Due report change requested in VistA Standardization waiver request \#475993 was incorporated. When running the PCE Encounter Summary and Provider Encounter Count reports, this adds the ability to select providers from a CPRS Team (OE/RR List).

#### Mapped Codes

In discussions with representatives from Billing and HIMS, it was determined that we do not want to make any entries into V CPT and V POV as a result of code mapping because this could cause issues with billing. Therefore, all entries generated as a result of code mapping will be stored in the V Standard Codes file.

When MSE codes are stored in V Standard Codes, if any of the following fields are populated in the mapped V-file, they will be stored in the associated V Standard Codes entry: Event Date and Time, Ordering Provider, Encounter Provider, Package, and Data Source.

If the code is not active on the Event Date, the MSE will not be stored in V Standard Codes.

When a code mapping is linked or a code mapping is deleted, a notification MailMan message is sent. It contains the number of entries linked or deleted.

A new data source, PCE CODE MAPPING, to be used when codes are added as a result of code mapping, is added as part of the post-installation process.

The PCE Workgroup decided that there can be duplicate codes on an encounter if they are from different sources. Accordingly, the duplicate check for MSE codes being filed in V Standard Codes checks for an exact match on the code, the date and time associated with the code, and the mapped source. If any of these is different, the code will be stored.

When a Lexicon update is installed, it triggers a protocol event. A PCE protocol was created and attached to the Lexicon protocol. The PCE protocol will produce a report listing mapped codes that are inactive and send it to the PCE mail group.

#### PXK Visit Data Event Protocol

When encounter data is added, edited, or deleted, PCE fires this protocol to notify all subscribing applications of the changes. Firing of the PXK Visit Data Event protocol was added to the mapped code linking and deletion processes.

#### Clinical Reminders Index

The new-style cross-references that set and kill the Clinical Reminders Index for V CPT, V Exam, V Health Factors, V Patient Ed, V POV, V Skin Test, and V Standard Codes were modified to use the Event Date and Time, if it was entered, instead of the Visit/Admit Date &Time. If it is not entered, then Visit/Admit Date &Time will be used. This change had already been made for V Immunization and V Skin Test as part of the VIMM project.

The Clinical Reminders Index rebuilding utility was updated to use Event Date and Time as described above.

V Standard Codes was added to the list of files in the Clinical Reminders Index rebuilding utility.

#### V-File APIs

Event Date and Time and Measurement were added to the data returned by the V-file APIs. This means Event Date and Time and Measurement will be additional Condition Subscript (CSUB) data in Clinical Reminders. CSUB data can be used in Clinical Reminders Condition statements and a few other places. They are defined and described in the Clinical Reminders Manager’s Manual.

### Clinical Reminders PXRM\*2.0\*42

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following were modified for PXRM\*2.0\*42:

1.  Clinical Reminders Index
2.  Reminder Computed Findings
3.  Reminder Definitions
4.  Reminder Evaluation
5.  Reminder Exchange
6.  Reminder Manager Menu
7.  Reminder Reports
8.  Reminder QUERI Extracts
9.  Reminder Taxonomies
10. Reminder Terms
11. Reminder Test
12. Self-Identified Gender

#### Clinical Reminders Index

V Standard Codes was added to the Clinical Reminders Index build/rebuilding utility.

#### Reminder Computed Findings

A test site for PXRM\*2.0\*47 found they had a number of instances where the Computed Finding Parameter for VA-REMINDER DEFINITION was the name of a definition that no longer existed. This could have been because the reminder definition was renamed or deleted. To handle this case where it was renamed, a change was made so the Computed Finding Parameter can be either the Internal Entry Number or the Name of the Reminder Definition.

Under certain circumstances, evaluating the national computed finding VA-BSA would produce the following error:

\<SUBSCRIPT\>GHEIGHT+16^PXRMBMI \*DIFFL("",0)

While evaluating reminder VA-BODY SURFACE AREA

For patient DFN=13

The time of the error was 11/13/2017@09:42:03

See the error trap for complete details.

GHEIGHT tries to find the height measurement made closest to the patient’s most recent weight measurement. The situation that generated the above error was that the patient had a height measured before the weight measurement but none after. This has been corrected.

#### Reminder Definitions

A site reported that when running the integrity check on a local reminder definition they were getting a hard error:

. I 'FIEVAL(LIST(IND)) Q

^

\<UNDEFINED\>MRD+6^PXRMFF0 \*FIEVAL("6")

The error was traced to two function findings in the definition that depend on finding 6, which does not exist. The function finding portion of the integrity checker was changed so it can handle non-existent findings.

The integrity checker was only checking for a frequency if resolution logic was defined. In this case, no frequency is a fatal error. A change was made so that if there is no resolution logic, a warning for no frequency is issued. If there is resolution logic, a fatal error is issued.

Puget Sound requested adding the ability to edit the print name for national definitions. The Workgroup concurred with the stipulation that site changes are tracked so when content updates are made, the site can determine what local changes were overwritten.

To meet these criteria, two new options were added to the REMINDER MANAGEMENT MENU:

- DEFINITION PRINT NAME EDIT and
- DEFINITION PRINT NAME REPORT

PXRM REMINDER MANAGEMENT Reminder Definition Management menu

RL List Reminder Definitions

RI Inquire about Reminder Definition

RE Add/Edit Reminder Definition

RC Copy Reminder Definition

RA Activate/Inactivate Reminders

HT Edit HT PERIODIC Reminder Definition Frequency

RH Reminder Edit History

ICS Integrity Check Selected

ICA Integrity Check All

PNE Definition Print Name Edit

PNR Definition Print Name Report

When the PNE option is selected, the user will be prompted to select a Reminder Definition. After a definition is selected, a ScreenMan form that has Print Name as the only editable field will be opened. The PNR option will run a report that finds all Reminder Definitions whose Print Name was edited using the PNE option. For each definition, it lists who edited the Print Name, when it was edited, the original Print Name, and the new Print Name.

The length of Print Name was increased from 35 to 64 characters.

#### Reminder Evaluation

The ability to use V Standard Codes in reminder evaluation and patient list building was added. Now, whenever Patient Data Source includes encounter data, V Standard Codes will be included in taxonomy evaluation. The Help text was updated to include V Standard Codes. A rebuild of the taxonomy “APDS” index was added to the post-installation routine.

The Clinical Maintenance output for Exams and Health Factors was changed to use the new Print Name field, if it is populated, otherwise the .01 will be used. Print Name was an existing field for Education Topics, so Print Name was already being used in this manner for Education Topics.

If there is no resolution logic, reminder frequency is not required so it will not create an error, but the following warning was added to the Clinical Maintenance output: “There is no reminder frequency!”

If there is resolution logic and no frequency, then the reminder cannot be evaluated, this generates a status of ERROR. Text was added to the Clinical Maintenance output with the error message: “There is resolution logic but no reminder frequency!”

Display of measurement data was added to the Clinical Maintenance output for Education Topics, Exams, Health Factors, and V Standard Codes.

#### Reminder Exchange

When PX\*1.0\*211 is installed, it adds the Class field to Education Topics, Exams, and Health Factors and it is a required field. Any Reminder Exchange (.prd) files created in an account that does not have PX\*1.0\*211 will not have these fields and consequently will not install in accounts with PX\*1.0\*211 installed. Reminder Exchange has been modified to eliminate this problem. If a Reminder Exchange entry that does not contain the Class field is being installed as part of KIDS install, Reminder Exchange will set it automatically to National. If the entry is being manually installed, the Class fields will be set to local. In the future, the Exchange prd file will contain information about the account where the prd file was created, and this will also be used to determine how to set the Class field if it is missing.

Another issue that Reminder Exchange must handle is the requirement that Health Factor Category names end in “\[C\].” Reminder Exchange tries to determine if an incoming category is new or if it is an existing category but is missing the “\[C\].” If it is new, it will install it and append the “\[C\]” to the name. If it already exists, any new incoming health factors in the category will have their category switched to the one with the appended “\[C\].”

When multiple Reminder Dialogs are included in a single exchange file entry, for each dialog, the Exchange dialog install software was restarting the install from the beginning of the dialog list. Because of this, dialog installation was slow and the display of the dialog was incorrect. This has been fixed. Now only items associated with the dialog selected for installation will be included in the display and installation list; dialogs will install much faster.

A Repack action was added to Reminder Exchange. This new action can be used to select an existing Reminder Exchange file entry and automatically repack it. If the Exchange file entry was originally packed in a different account, the repack may fail because one or more of the components may not exist in the account where the repack is being done.

During an install, if a component was already installed in the account and found to be identical to what is in the Exchange entry, Reminder Exchange was writing out the message: “FILE NAME entry named NAME already exists and the packed component is identical, skipping."

For some Exchange installs, there could be many of these messages and displaying them slowed down the install. Now, these messages will no longer be written out, instead a single period ‘.’ will be written to let the user know Reminder Exchange is processing the entry.

As part of the packing process, the Reminder Integrity Checker will now be run on every definition that is to be included in the Reminder Exchange file entry. If a definition has fatal errors, the packing process will abort.

In the past during an install, if a finding in a definition, term, or dialog did not exist, the user was prompted to input a replacement for every instance of the missing finding in the components being installed. Changes have been made to keep track of finding replacements, so now the user will only have to enter the replacement once. After the replacement has been entered the first time, every subsequent instance of the missing finding will be automatically replaced.

The way dialogs are stored in an Exchange File entry was restructured so that they will install much faster. This means that dialogs packed before this restructuring need to have a conversion run on them. A means to determine if the conversion needs to be done necessitated creating a mechanism for storing and reading packing attributes. The attributes are stored in the Exchange File entry when it is created and read when it is installed. This is all done automatically and does not require any action by the Reminder Exchange user.

RECORDING THAT AN ERROR OCCURRED ---

This was occurring because the variable PXRMLCSC was not defined as a result of the “^” input. The code was changed to properly handle the “^” input.

#### Reminder QUERI Extracts

The data from the Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) and (Mental Health) MH QUERI extracts is no longer being used. Therefore, the monthly run of these extracts is being stopped and all the old QUERI patient lists are being deleted. The following options are deleted, and their scheduling is removed:

- PXRM EXTRACT VA-IHD QUERI
- PXRM EXTRACT VA-MH QUERI

#### Reminder Taxonomies

A user reported that when using the Use In Dialog Edit (UIDE) action, if you quit without saving and selected another taxonomy for UIDE, the codes from the original taxonomy were still displayed. This was corrected.

When using the UIDE action, it was not clear whether or not codes could be marked as Use In Dialog (UID). This display was changed to explicitly state whether or not codes can be marked as UID.

#### Reminder Terms

A Reminder Term Test option was added to the Reminder Term Management menu. The user is prompted for a patient and a term. The term is evaluated and the True or False value and the FIEVAL (Finding Evaluation) array are written out.

#### Reminder Test

The reminder global variables and their values are now displayed in Reminder Test.

#### Self-Identified Gender

Self-identified gender has been added to the Patient file, and consequently it has been added as a new reminder global variable named PXRMSIG. PXRMSIG can be used exactly like any of the already existing reminder global variables such as PXRMSEX or PXRMDOB.

### Health Summary GMTS\*2.7\*122

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

One of the changes in PX\*1.0\*211 was to add a Print Name for Education Topics, Exams, and Health Factors. The purpose of the Print Name is to provide a more “user friendly” display. In contrast with the Name (.01) field, which is all upper case, the Print Name is mixed case. The Health Summary components for Education Topics, Exams, and Health Factors were changed to use the Print Name instead of the Name. If, for some reason, the Print Name is not defined, the Name field will be used.

Originally, the output formats for Education Topics, Exams, and Health Factors were not consistent as these examples show:

Data Source: PXCE DATA ENTRY

Note that Data Source is now included. The original routines had code to display Data Source, but it was not working. This has been corrected. If an associated measurement is present, it will be displayed also.

### Problem List GMPL\*2.0\*53

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

One of the changes in PX\*1\*211 is to change the length of the Provider Narrative “B” index from 30 characters to the full length of the .01 which is 245 characters. This necessitated a change in the API PROVNARR^PXAPI which was written back when the maximum length of the “B” index could only be 30 characters. The Problem List API PROVNARR^GMPLX was also written for a 30-character index and would not function correctly with the new full-length index. PROVNARR^GMPLX provides the same functionality as PROVNARR^PXAPI, so instead of having two copies of essentially the same code, ICR \#6953 was created to allow Problem List to use PROVNARR^PXAPI.

While making the above changes to GMPLX, we noticed that it was making calls to various entry points in ICDXCODE routine which has been deprecated and replaced by ICDEX. These calls were replaced with the corresponding calls in ICDEX.

### Order Entry/Results Reporting OR\*3.0\*501

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When Order Entry was calling the DATA2PCE API it was not properly passing the variable PPEDIT. The call to DATA2PCE in the routine ORWPCE1 was corrected so it properly passes PPEDIT.

## Known Issues

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Appendix: Unique Sections from Prior Versions

_These sections appeared in earlier versions of this document but are not present in the current master. They may describe features, procedures, or configurations that were removed, superseded, or restructured._

### From: PX*1*234 PCE Standardization Release Notes

## PX HF MEASUREMENTS REPAIR

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When the PX\*1\*234 patch is installed, an automatic repair of the corrupted data is applied. Members of the PCE Management Mail Group will receive one and possibly two MailMan messages. Each of these messages will have a different course of action.

### HEALTH FACTORS WITH INCOMPLETE MESUREMENT DEFINITION

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When a message with the subject: HEALTH FACTORS WITH INCOMPLETE MEASUREMENT DEFINITION is received, it means that one or more health factors having an incomplete measurement definition were found during the installation process. The user can add the missing fields using the Health Factor Management menu option.

Sample message:

Subj: HEALTH FACTORS WITH INCOMPLETE MEASUREMENT DEFINITION (#109720)

12/15/22@16:46 18 lines

From: PCE Support In ‘IN’ basket. Page 1 \*New\*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following health factors have incomplete measurement definitions, they should be completed as soon as possible.

Example 1

MINIMUM VALUE: 32

MAXIMUM VALUE: 123

MAXIMUM DECIMALS: 1

UCUM CODE: Weber

PROMPT CAPTION: Missing

UCUM DISPLAY: Missing

Example 2

MINIMUM VALUE: -12.3

MAXIMUM VALUE: 12.3

MAXIMUM DECIMALS: 1

UCUM CODE: part per million

PROMPT CAPTION: Missing

UCUM DISPLAY: Missing

Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore//

If there are any HFs with incomplete measurement definitions they should be corrected before starting the manual VHF repair.

### V HEALTH FACTORS MEASUREMENT REPAIR 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When a message with the subject: V HEALTH FACTORS MEASUREMENT REPAIR is received, it means that there are VHF entries that could not be automatically repaired. These items will require human interaction for correction.

> **NOTE:** If there are LCS HEALTH FACTORS listed, the site LCS coordinator should assist with the correction.

The sample message below shows entry 188201 can not be automatically repaired. It is missing the MAGNITUDE entry.

Sample message:

Subj: V HEALTH FACTORS MEASUREMENT REPAIR (#295925)

01/04/23@11:43 26 lines

From: PCE Support In ‘IN’ basket. Page 1 \*New\*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V HEALTH FACTORS measurement repair completed at Jan 04, 2023@11:43:10

Measurements were repaired for 3 entries.

There were 2 V HEALTH FACTORS entries that could not be automatically repaired:

Health Factor: VA-HTN SELF-RECORDED SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE

Minimum Value: 5

Maximum Value: 300

Maximum Decimals: 0

UCUM Code: millimeter of mercury

V Health Factors IEN: 188201

Visit: Jan 04, 2023@7:42

Patient: CPRSONE, PATIENT

MAGNITUDE: Missing; UCUM CODE: millimeter of mercury

Comments: EIGHTY

Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore//

To make repairs:

In VistA use the option PX HF MEASUREMENT REPAIR and follow the below prompts. This option should be assigned to the person who will make the repairs. It starts a repair measurement editor.

> **NOTE:** You will need the VHF IEN listed in the MailMan message.

V HEALTH FACTOR MEASUREMENT REPAIR

Edit the measurement for selected V HEALTH FACTOR entries.  
Input the internal entry number, or press ENTER to exit: 188201 \<Enter\>

VA-HTN SELF-RECORDED SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE CPRSONE,PATIENT JAN 4,2023@07:42  
NATIONAL

...OK? Yes// (Yes)

Health Factor: VA-HTN SELF-RECORDED SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE  
MINIMUM VALUE: 5  
MAXIMUM VALUE: 300  
MAXIMUM DECIMALS: 0  
UCUM DESCRIPTION: millimeter of mercury  
COMMENTS: EIGHTY  
MAGNITUDE: 80 \<Enter\>

UCUM CODE: millimeter of mercury//\<Enter\>

The editor displays the allowed range and units for the measurement. In the above example, a human can interpret “EIGHTY” in the COMMENTS field to be the number 80 and recognize that it is in the inclusive range 5 to 300, so the MAGNITUDE can be set to 80.

As you work through the list, there will be COMMENTS where it is straight forward to determine a magnitude and others where a magnitude cannot be determined. When a magnitude cannot be determined, the UCUM CODE should be deleted.

V HEALTH FACTOR MEASUREMENT REPAIR

Edit the measurement for selected V HEALTH FACTOR entries.  
Input the internal entry number, or press ENTER to exit: 188114 \<Enter\>

VA-HTN SELF-RECORDED SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE CPRSONE,PATIENT JAN 4,2023@07:42  
NATIONAL

...OK? Yes// (Yes)

Health Factor: VA-HTN SELF-RECORDED SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE  
MINIMUM VALUE: 5  
MAXIMUM VALUE: 300  
MAXIMUM DECIMALS: 0  
UCUM DESCRIPTION: millimeter of mercury  
COMMENTS: Can’t recall

MAGNITUDE:\<Enter\>

UCUM CODE: millimeter of mercury//@\<Enter\>

When there is a valid measurement, both MAGNITUDE and UCUM CODE must be stored in the VHF entry. If there is no measurement, then neither MAGNITUDE or UCUM CODE should be present. If only one of those two fields is present it can cause Health Summary errors.

Shown below are the two LCS health factors measurement definitions and some actual COMMENTS from a site. Each comment is followed by a suggestion for what to do about setting the magnitude. In the suggestions, CNBD stands for Cannot be Determined, in those cases if the UCUM CODE is present it should be deleted.

LCS PACKS/DAY

MINIMUM VALUE: 0 MAXIMUM VALUE: 10 MAXIMUM DECIMALS: 2

UCUM CODE: number PROMPT CAPTION: Packs/day UCUM DISPLAY: NO DISPLAY

In determining packs/day, it is helpful to know a pack contains 20 cigarettes.

COMMENTS:

3/4 = 0.75

4 CIGARS PER DAY = CNBD, this is for cigarette smoking only.

"3 days to finish pack" = 0.33

"I never smoked a pack in a day" = CNBD

chews all day. = CNBD, this is for smoking cigarettes, not chewing.

unkn = CNBD

3- 4 cans per week = CNBD, this is for smoking cigarettes, not chewing.

1 CIGARETTE DAILY = 1/20 = 0.05

3 cig/day = CNBD, this is for cigarette smoking only.

LCS YEARS SMOKED

MINIMUM VALUE: 0 MAXIMUM VALUE: 80 MAXIMUM DECIMALS: 1

UCUM CODE: number PROMPT CAPTION: \# of years UCUM DISPLAY: NO DISPLAY

COMMENTS:

3 cigarettes a day for 60 years = 60

10 cigarettes per day = CNBD

\>15 years = 15

pt reports smoking 1 pack daily for over 40 yrs = 40

unsure = CNBD

1/2 pack per day for 30 years = 30

1/2 pk per day or less over 30 years = 30

1 CIGAR EVERY SUNDAY = CNBD

40+ years = 40
