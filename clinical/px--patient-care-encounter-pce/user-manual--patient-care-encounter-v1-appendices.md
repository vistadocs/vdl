## Appendix A-1 Start-up Process for Implementing Reminders

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

*1. Gather copies of the Appendix A worksheets*

> Appendix A-2 Clinical Reminders at a Glance

> Appendix A-3 Clinical Reminder Definition Worksheet

> Appendix A-4 PCE Clinical Integration Worksheet

*2. Review the reminders distributed with PCE.*

- Use Appendix A-8 to review distributed reminders names, and how they relate to each other.
- Number of Reminder Items distributed:

> NCHP VA-\* prefixed reminder items - 15

> Amb Care EP’s VA- prefixed reminder items - 22

*3. Become familiar with the distributed taxonomies.*

- Use Appendix A-9 to review distributed taxonomies.
- Number of taxonomies distributed: 30

*4. Identify preventive maintenance guidelines to be used for start-up*

- Identify clinician(s) who want their clinic to be the start-up clinic for the reminders. Ideally, this should be a clinician who uses encounter forms and health summaries and wants to be actively involved with the clinic's encounter form and reminder definition process.
- Identify the coordinator who defines the clinic's Encounter Form(s). Inform the coordinator about the reminder definition process, and that it could impact the clinicians' encounter form definition. Get a copy of the current encounter form definition used by the clinic.
- Work with the clinician to identify the category of reminder(s) from the distributed list in Appendix A-8 that the clinician would like to start with. The VA-\* and VA- reminders that are similar are listed next to each other in Appendix A-2. This gives an overview of the reminders by guideline category and how they relate to each other. Each row in Appendix A-2 contains the reminders that address the same preventive maintenance guideline, each with a little different definition. The last column is reserved for the coordinator for tracking purposes to indicate the local reminder that is being used to satisfy the preventive maintenance guideline.
- Use Appendix A-4 to identify the appropriate coordinators for resolving the overlap between package managment of PCE table, clinical reminder, Health Summary, and Encounter Form definitions.
5. *Identify how the clinician would like to see preventive maintenance guideline implemented in his/her clinic:*
- Show the clinician the “VA-\*” (NCHP) and “VA-” (Amb Care EP) prefixed detailed definitions of reminders that relate to the category of guidelines the clinician is interested in. For each definition review the following:

Print Name

What text does the clinician want to see on the Health Summary to identify this reminder on the Health Summary?

Age Findings

What age range(s) (if any) should be in effect for this reminder? How frequently should the reminder be due? Keep in mind that Taxonomy, and Health Factor findings can alter the age range and frequency criteria.

Target Result Findings Items

Determine if the items are appropriate for your site. Check the items content based on your local definitions from the target result findings file. If the Target Result Finding file is one of those in the left column below, answer the question in the right column.

> Lab Test (Chemistry & What are the laboratory test names that should Hematology only) be looked for to satisfy the reminder?

> Radiology Procedure What are the radiology procedure names that should be looked for to satisfy the reminder?

> Measurement What are the measurements that should be looked for to satisfy the reminder?

> Education What are the education topics that should be looked for to satisfy the reminder?

> Immunization What are the immunizations that should be looked for to satisfy the reminder?

> Exam What are the exams that should be looked for to satisfy the reminder?

> Skin Test What are the skin tests that should be looked for to satisfy the reminder?

> Procedure What are the CPT codes and ICD Operation/Procedure codes that should be looked for to satisfy the reminder?

Taxonomy Items

Get a detailed list of the taxonomy definitions currently defined for the reminder. (See Appendix A-9 for a list of distributed taxonomy definitions. For each taxonomy, review the list with the clinician and decide if it is appropriate. If not, develop a new list and create a taxonomy reflecting the new list. Keep track of these coded values for integration with the Encounter form. (The clinician may already be collecting preferred codes on the encounter form. The clinic's Encounter Form may be useful to have available during this process.)

- If the patient is found to have a match with the taxonomy:
- Decide if the age range and/or reminder frequency should be altered and if it is what the rank shound be.
- Decide if the taxonomy can be used to satisfy the reminder.
- Decide what (if any) found text message should be displayed on the Clinical Maintenance component. (The date and what was found will be displayed in the Clinical Maintenance component.)
- Decide if the taxonomy should control whether or not the reminder is applicable.
- If the patient is not found to have a match with the taxonomy:
- Decide what (if any) non-found text message should be displayed on the Clinical Maintenance component.
- Is there a generic found text or not-found text that the clinician would like to see if any of the taxonomies were matched, or if none of the taxonomies were matched?

Health Factor Findings Items

- What are the health factors that should be looked for to satisfy the reminder?
- If the patient has the health factor information on file:
- Decide if the age range and/or reminder frequency should be altered.
- Replace the taxonomy with the health factor.
- Decide what (if any) found text message should be displayed on the Clinical Maintenance component. (The date and what was found will be displayed in the Clinical Maintenance component.)
- Repeat the taxonomy with the health factor.
- If the patient is not found to have the health factor information on file:
- Decide what (if any) not-found text message should be displayed on the Clinical Maintenance component.
- Is there a generic found text or not-found text that the clinician would like to see if any of the health factors were found, or if none of the health factors were found?

Use the Appendix A-3, Clinical Reminder Definition Worksheet, as a tool to map out the desired definitions for the local reminders. Alternatively, if one of the distributed reminders is very close, make the changes on the distributed print of the reminder definitions.

If answers to any of the questions above were different than the distributed definition, than a local reminder definition must be created for the preventive maintenance guideline.

*6. Review and edit Reminder/Maintenance file entries, as needed:*

- For each specified reminder definition, the PCE files may require new entries to support the reminder. For PCE files review the following files and answer the questions in the right column.

> Education Topic Are the education topics already defined

> in the Education Topics file?

> Immunization Are the immunizations already defined in

> the Immunization file?

> Exam Are the exams already defined in the

> Exam file?

> Skin Test Are the skin tests already defined in the

> Skin Test file?

> Taxonomy Is there a taxonomy defined that addresses

> the ICD Diagnosis, ICD Operation/

> Procedure and CPT codes that should be

> looked for to satisfy the reminder.

> Keep in mind multiple taxonomies may be

> defined, each with a different emphasis

> on grouping.

*7. Resolve integration issues between the clinic's encounter form and reminder definition:*

- For each reminder to be used, determine what items identified as part of the reminder's criteria should be captured off the encounter form?
- Vital types for measurement reminders
- Education Topics for education reminders
- Immunizations for immunization reminders
- Exams for Exam reminders
- Skin Tests for Skin Test reminders
- Taxonomies with CPT codes and ICD Operation/Procedure codes for Procedure reminders
- Taxonomies with ICD codes for diagnosis tracking/reminder alteration within the reminder definition
- Health Factors for Health Factor tracking/reminder alteration within the reminder definition
- The Clinical Coordinator responsible for the clinics’ Encounter Form(s) definitions needs to make the appropriate changes to begin collecting any new data that is needed to meet the preventive maintenance guidelines.

*8. Define a PCE Reminder/Maintenance Item for each unique reminder:*

- Use the PCE Reminder Maintenance Menu option, “Copy reminder Item,” to copy and edit an existing reminder. You may also create a new reminder from scratch, but is is usually easier to start with an existing reminder.

> **NOTE:** The technical descriptions may be useful for summarizing what your goals are for the reminder and for sharing with other sites.

*9. Test the reminder:*

There are two ways to test a reminder:

- Add the reminder to a test Health Summary. Using a test health summary shows how the reminder looks from a user’s perspective.
- Use the Reminder Test option, as described in Appendix A-7. The Reminder Test option can be a useful tool to reminder developers for debugging reminders that don’t work as expected.

To test a reminder using Health Summary:

1\. Add the Clinical Maintenance and Clinical Reminder components to the reminder health summary type. Select the reminder item(s) to be tested in the selection item’s prompt from Clinical Maintenance and Clinical Reminder components.

Health Summary reminder components

|                      |                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CLINICAL REMINDERS   | This component evaluates patient findings to determine if the reminder is DUE NOW.                                                           |
| CLINICAL MAINTENANCE | This component evaluates patient findings and reports the findings or lack of findings used to determine whether or not the reminder is due. |

> **NOTE:** If you can’t select the PCE Clinical Maintenance or PCE Clinical Reminder components for the Health Summary, the components must be enabled for use, and the “Rebuild Ad Hoc Health Summary Type” option must be run.

2\. Use the Print Health Summary Menu, “Patient Health Summary” option to begin testing the component for individual patients. Find or create test patients with data in V*IST*A that match the reminder definitions, as well as some that won’t have data matches. Assess the reminder results:

- Are the age range and frequency evaluation working?
- Are the target findings found or not found as expected?
- Are the taxonomy findings found or not found as expected?
- Are the health factors found or not found as expected?
- If match and no-match are defined, are they being displayed?
- Are alterations of age and frequency criteria working as expected based on taxonomy or health factor findings?

3\. Use the Print Health Summary Menu, “Hospital Location Health Summary” option to print the reminders for a clinic, based on a recently passed date range, or next week’s date range. Did the Health Summary print run to completion without any errors?

4\. Contact IRMS if you encounter errors. <span class="mark">REDACTED</span>

5\. Do not add reminders that are causing errors to the clinic’s health summary. Make the reminders inactive until the problem is resolved.

6\. Once the reminder is working as expected, show the clinician the reminder defintions, samples of the health summary components results and possibly the encounter form. Gather feedback.

7\. If necessary, make modifications to the reminder defintion, taxonomies, and encounter forms. After the modifications have been made, resume the testing.

8\. Identify the Health Summary Coordinator for the clinic. Provide the coordinator with the list of selection item reminders that the clinician has selected for their clinic.

9\. The Health Summary Coordinator must add the Clinical Reminder and/or Clinical Maintenance components to the clinic’s Health Summary Type, adding the selection items for the Reminder/Maintenance Items.

\*\*A/I=Active/InactiveClinical Reminders at a Glance Worksheet Instructions

Use the table on the previous page as a worksheet to help track a clinic's selected reminders. Each row of this table represents variations of the same type of reminder.

1\. Become familiar with the distributed reminder definitions found in A-8. The VA-\* prefixed reminders, based on definitions by the National Center for Health Promotion (NCHP), represent a minimum set of reminders which sites must be able to report on yearly to comply with Congressional law.

2\. The VA- reminders are site and Ambulatory Care Expert Panel examples of reminders. When a VA- reminder is in the column next to a VA-\* reminder, the VA- reminder is an example of an alternative reminder that still addressess the NCHP guideline.

3\. Use Appendix A-3 as a worksheet for developing the local reminders. This includes requirements for taxonomies, health factors, and target findings that are needed to meet your site's preventive maintenance guidelines.

4\. Use the PCE Table Maintenance options to create any new education topics, exams, immunizations, skin tests, and health factors needed by the reminders.

5\. Use the Taxonomy Copy and Add/Edit options to create and modify site taxonomies, if the distributed taxonomies need modifications.

6\. Use the Reminder Copy and Edit options to create and modify site reminders if the distributed reminders need modifications. Make sure that the NCHP Guideline field is filled in if the site reminder is replacing a VA-\* version of a reminder.

7\. Add the names of any local site reminders into table A-2.

8\. Use table A-2 to identify the reminders that you will actually use and enter an A in the boxes of the A/I column. This will summarize which reminders should be makred active.

9\. Inactivate any reminders which will not be used by your site. As reminders are identified, you can summarize which reminders won’t be used by entering I in the A/I boxes.

10\. Test reminders by adding the reminders to a test Health Summary Types' Clinical Maintenance or Clinical Reminder components, or reference the reminders in the AD HOC Health Summary option for the Clinical Maintenance or Clinical Reminder components. You can also test reminders by using the Reminder Test option (see Appendix A-7). Initially, you may want to focus only on the Clinical Maintenance component to ensure that the V*IST*A data is being evaluated appropriately.

> **NOTE:** If you’re using reminders for performance measures, you may want to create your own table, listing the performance measure being met and the related reminder.

=================== TAXONOMY FINDINGS (optional-multiple) ===================

You will need to fill out one of these sheets for each taxonomy used by the reminder. One General Found and Not Found Text may be defined for all the taxonomies if appropriate.

TAXONOMY (opt): You can define more than one taxonomy in the reminder definition, and alter the reminder criteria based on whether the patient has a match. Enter the Taxonomy name, or just list the ICD Diagnosis, ICD Operation Procedure, or CPT codes which need searched for. If no taxonomy containing these codes exist, you will need to create one.

TAXONOMY ITEM(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

============== HEALTH FACTOR FINDINGS (optional - multiple) =================

You will need to fill out one of these sheets for each health factor used by the reminder. One General Found and Not Found Text may be defined for all the health factors if appropriate.

HEALTH FACTOR FINDINGS (opt)

These are the health factors that should be evaluated as findings for this reminder. Each health factor is defined in the Health Factor file with a health factor category. A match on the most recent health factor finding item(s) found for a patient represented in the reminder defintion may be used to alter the reminder criteria. Multiple most recent health factor finding item(s) are based on the health factor category the health factor findings item belonged to. If 5 health factor finding items are defined in the reminder, from 2 unique health factor categories, then only the two most recent health factor findings (1 from each category) for a patient will be used by the reminder.

HEALTH FACTOR FINDINGS ITEM (opt): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Appendix A-5 Designing Encounter Forms based on Preventive Maintenance Guidelines

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Health Summary provides critical clinical information related to the patient for Ambulatory Care Encounters. The Encounter Form is a means of documenting clinical activity/updates for a patient during the patients encounter. This appendix sub-section gives a brief overview of how PCE, AICS, and Health Summary packages impact the clinician for tracking a patient's preventive maintenance guidelines. The following is a possible scenario for the clinician:

1. A clinician receives the Encounter Form and Health Summary for use during the encounter.
2. The clinician reviews the Clinical Reminder component and/or the Clinical Maintenance component for items that are “DUE NOW.”
3. The Encounter Form is predefined with a format that supports the clinical activity related to the reminders. If the clinician is going to ask about education, the clinician should also be prepared to give the appropriate education and document the information gathered from the inquiry.

Recommendation: If a clinician asks about the education needed and finds that education is needed, but isn’t able to give the education, the *screening bubble should not be checked off* on the encounter form. The screening should be filled in when the clinician determines education is not indicated or when the clinician screens *and* gives the education.

Two examples of encounter forms are shown on the following pages with items that might be included to support reminders. These examples are:

- An abbreviated format for a clinic that is not interested in tracking details related to the reminders.
- An example of how detailed a clinic could choose to go with data capture related to the reminders.

If the clinician gives abbreviated education for all facets of the education topic, then the “Alcohol Use Education” header should be the box checked, otherwise check-off the appropriate education given. If the clinician has health factor and diagnosis findings that he or she would like to see documented during the screening process, the appropriate boxes should be checked off.

*a) Minimum Set*

The following example represents a “minimum set” of information (without bubbles) that we recommend for the encounter form. It satisfies NCHP and can also be captured by PCE based on current PCE definitions. If new education topics are needed to represent the remaining screening items, they can be added.

## Appendix A-6 Technical Overview of Reminder Logic

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> **NOTE:** This overview is extracted from the PCE REMINDER/ MAINTENANCE ITEM file data dictionary description.

This file contains the defintions of reminders which can be selected for use in the Health Summary package components:

> CLINICAL REMINDERS - This component evaluates patient findings

> to determine if the reminder is "DUE NOW."

> CLINICAL MAINTENANCE - This component evaluates patient

> findings and reports the findings or lack of findings used to

> determine whether or not the reminder is due.

Reminder definitions are contained in this file. Each reminder is categorized by "Reminder Type." Based on the reminder type, a "Target Result Findings File" is specified along with the particular items from that file that should be used. For example, for an immunization reminder the target is the IMMUNIZATION file. The particular items would the the name(s) of the immunizations. For each specified immunization, the V IMMUNIZATION file is searched for patient results. For laboratory reminders, exact names used by the site make up the item list.

Target age groups may be defined for each reminder in this file, based on patient's age. Reminder frequencies may be defined by age ranges in the Baseline Age Findings multiple. The age range and reminder frequency to use for the reminder can be altered based on findings of diagnosis, procedure, or health factor data related to a specific patient. The patient's age from PIMS is used for age findings.

Diagnosis and Procedure findings are based on definitions of coded standard ranges defined in the Taxonomy file. The Taxonomy file is distributed with predefined definitions for all reminders distributed by the PCE package. Facilities may create their own taxonomies to use in locally defined reminders. The taxonomies defined for evaluating patient data for diagnosis and procedure findings for a reminder are defined in the "Taxonomy Findings" fields. Based on the patient taxonomy findings, a reminder's frequency and minimum and maximum age criteria can be changed. Text may be defined which will be displayed in the Health Summary "Clinical Maintenance" component to reflect taxonomy findings found or not found in the patient data.

If a taxonomy definition in the Taxonomy file is defined with ICD Diagnosis code ranges, the following files are checked for findings of a code within the Diagnosis ranges specified:

PROBLEM File (AUPNPROB) in Problem List

V POV File (AUPNVPOV) in PCE (representing problems/diagnosis treated

at encounter)

PTF File (DGPT) in PIMS (Inpatient Diagnosis summary information)

If a taxonomy definition in the Taxonomy file is defined with CPT code ranges, the following patient file is checked for findings of a code within the CPT ranges specified:

V-CPT File (PCE, representing procedures done at patient encounters)

If a taxonomy definition in the Taxonomy file is defined with ICD Operation/

Procedure codes, the following patient file is checked for findings of a code within the ICD Operation/Procedure code ranges specified:

PTF File (PIMS, Inpatient Operation/Procedures summary information)

Health factors are defined in the Health Factors file, and can be used to identify health indicators for use with reminders. These factors are not based on a coded standard. A pre-defined set of health factors distributed by PCE is used by the distributed reminders. Facilities may create their own health factors to use in locally defined reminders. The health factors defined for evaluating patient data for this reminder are defined in the "Health Factor Findings" fields. Based on the patient health factor findings, a reminder's frequency and minimum and maximum age criteria can be changed. Text may be defined which will be displayed in the Health Summary "Clinical Maintenance" component to reflect health factor findings found or not found in the patient data.

PCE's "V HEALTH FACTORS" file represents a patient's health factors recorded as of a given encounter date. All Health factors defined in the reminder are used to evaluate patient information in the "V HEALTH FACTORS" file. Out of all the health factor findings, the most recnet health factor finding within each health factor category will be used for the reminder processing.

Health factors can be used to record “pertinent negative findings” for example “lifetime non-smoker”. Pertinent negative findings can be used to make a reminder non-applicalbe via an “AND NOT” entry in the Use in Apply Logic field. The Health Factor File contains INACTIVATE and ACTIVATE health factors for each NCHP (VA-\* prefixed) reminder. The VA-\* reminder defintions provide examples of how the INACTIVATE health factor can be used to stop a reminder for a particular patient. This provides a generic mechanism to record pertinent negatives. The Health Factor Comment field can be used to record the reason for inactivating the reminder.

Computed Findings may also be used in the reminder logic. Computed Findings are based on the evaluation of M logic as true or false. The distributed reminders includes an example of computed findings to evaluate patient height and weight information to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and compare it to a national standard of 27 indicating obesity. Local facilities may program their own computed findings for use with reminders.

A complete description of the elements of this file and how they actually define a reminder can be found in Appendix A-7, Developing and Customizing Clinical Reminders.

Each processing step of the reminder logic can create output. This output is stored in a working array that is built up as the reminder is processed.

General Reminder Logic

The general logic is very similar for every reminder. Specific differences for each reminder type can be found in the Reminder Type File.

SEX SPECIFIC - If the reminder is sex specific, the sex of the patient is compared with the reminder sex. If the patient is the wrong sex, go to step OUTPUT, otherwise continue.

HEALTH FACTORS - If there are health factors associated with the reminder they are compared with the health factors associated with the patient. These are found in the file AUPNVHF. Any matching health factors are stored in the health factor array HFA.

STANDARD CODED ITEMS - Standard coded items are specified for the reminder by a list of Taxonomies. The entries in the Taxonomy files specify a range of codes (low to high) and the file the codes come from. The permissible taxonomy entries are ICD diagnosis (file 80 <span id="p199_28" class="anchor"></span>ICD), ICD operation/procedure (file 80.1 ICD0), and CPT (file 81 ICPT). For each taxonomy entry, a list of internal entry numbers (iens) corresponding to the codes within the specified range is built. These lists are ICD9IEN, ICD0IEN, and ICPTIEN. Next a list of iens is built for the patient. ICD9 patient entries are searched for in the Problem of Visit File V POV (AUPNVPOV), the Patient Treatment File (DGPT), and the Problem List File (AUPNPROB). We search for ICD0 entries in DGPT and ICPT entries in V CPT (AUPNVCPT). The patient entries and taxonomy entries are examined for matches. The most recent entry is retained. In the case of ICD9 or ICD10, the most recent entry in each of the possible search files is retained.

COMPUTED FINDINGS - If a computed finding has been defined for the reminder it is evaluated.

BASELINE CRITERIA - The baseline values for minimum age, maximum age, and reminder frequency are established by determining the appropriate age range for the patient.

FINAL CRITERIA - Each computed finding, health factor and taxonomy can have a minimum age, maximum age, and frequency associated with it. When a particular item is found and it has a minimum age, maximum age, and frequency the baseline values are replaced by these values. In the case where there is more than one applicable computed finding, health factor, or taxonomy, and there are conflicting ages or frequencies the conflict is resolved by 1) using the rank frequency filed to specify the ranking, with number 1 being the highest rank frequency; 2) (when rank frequency not defined) using the frequency and age range that has the frequency that will make the reminder be given most often.

AGE CHECK - After the previous step is complete, final values for minimum age and maximum age are available. A null value has special significance. It means that no check is to be made. Thus if the minimum age is null and the maximum age is 65 then the reminder is applicable to all patients through age 65. If the patient does not meet the age criteria, we go to step OUTPUT, otherwise we continue.

APPLY LOGIC - An optional “apply logic” string can be given as part of the reminder definition. When it is not modified by a user, a default APPLY LOGIC string is created, based on the reminder definition. The string specifies Boolean logical combinations of computed findings, health factors and taxonomies. This gives us the ability to precisely define when the reminder should be given. For example, we could require that a particular taxonomy be found before the reminder is given. The USE IN APPLY LOGIC field for the taxonomy is defined with “AND”. The default logic looks for all USE IN APPLY LOGIC references to build the APPLY LOGIC string.The string is in the form of a MUMPS logical string. An example is: (SEX)&(AGE)&TF(5)). SEX and AGE will always be part of the default APPLY LOGIC. The USE IN APPLY LOGIC field for taxonomies, health factors, and computed findings can be defined as “AND”, “OR”, “AND NOT”, “OR NOT”, logic, as needed.

TARGET PATIENT ENTRIES - A list of all the patient's entries in the target file is built. The specific targets depend upon the reminder. They can be found in the Reminder Type file.

MOST RECENT TARGET DATE - The patient list is matched against the entries in the target file for the reminder topic and the date the reminder was last given is determined.

DUE DETERMINATION - The date found in the previous step along with the dates for any taxonomies, health factors, and computed findings that have USE IN DATE DUE CALC marked as YES are compared to find the most recent date. The most recent date, the final reminder frequency, and do in advance time are used to determine when the reminder is due.

OUTPUT - The final step is to take all the information stored in the working array and format it for Health Summary to display.

Introduction

The Clinical Reminders/Clinical Maintenance portion of PCE (namespace PXRM) can be called by Health Summary to provide clinical reminder or maintenance information for a patient. The PXRM routines and associated data files have been developed to allow sites maximum flexibility both for customizing reminders and for developing new ones. This appendix section provides detailed information about customizing or developing new reminders.

The easiest way to create a new reminder is to copy an existing one and then edit it.

Menu options to aid the customization and development of new reminders include

*PXRM Reminder Cop*y, *PXRM Reminder Edi*t, *PXRM Taxonomy Cop*y, and *PXRMTaxonomy Edi*t.

Files associated with PXRM:

PCE REMINDER/MAINTENANCE ITEM (#811.9)

PCE REMINDER TYPE (#811.8)

PCE TAXONOMY (#811.2)

The contents and use of each of these files are described below.

Reminder Definition

The primary file is PCE REMINDER/MAINTENANCE ITEM, which provides the

definition of a reminder item. The other two files provide auxiliary information

required for defining the item. Since the ability to set up or modify an item requires

an understanding of the contents of this file, each of the fields is described below.

Group 0

NAME - This is the name of the reminder; examples: VA-BLOOD PRESSURE, VA-MAMMOGRAM, and VA-CHOLESTEROL.

REMINDER TYPE - This is a pointer to the PCE REMINDER TYPE file and

defines the type of reminder. The defined types are EDUCATION, EXAMINATION,

IMMUNIZATION, MEASUREMENT, PROCEDURE, RADIOLOGY, and SKIN

TEST. Every reminder must be one of these types.

PRINT NAME - This is the name that will be used when the reminder is printed in

the Health Summary.

DO IN ADVANCE TIME FRAME - This is a time window used in the due now

calculation. If a reminder was due in 20 days and this parameter had the value

30D, then the reminder would be marked as due now. However, if the reminder was

due in 35 days it would not be marked as due.

See the reminder frequency description in Group 7 for a description of how to enter

time units.

RELATED REMINDER STANDARD - This is a pointer to one of the NCHP

reminders distributed with the Clinical Reminders. It is used to mark a reminder as

meeting or exceeding the requirements of a particular NCHP reminder.

INACTIVE FLAG - This flag marks a reminder as active or inactive for use by

Health Summary. The option (IN)/ACTIVATE REMINDERS can be used to change

this flag.

IGNORE ON N/A - The default behavior of the Clinical Maintenance component is

to give a message that a reminder is non-applicable, N/A, due to the patient’s sex or

age. This field is a string consisting of single letters that will prevent these

messages from being displayed. To prevent the age message from being displayed

this field should contain an “A.” Similarly, for sex it should contain an “S.”

SEX SPECIFIC - This field is used to make a reminder sex-specific. The entry is a

single letter code, F for female and M for male. If it is left blank, then the reminder

is applicable for either sex.

TARGET RESULT FINDINGS FILE - This is a pointer to target file. For example

if the reminder was of type education then the target file would be the Education

Topics file.

TARGET RESULT DESCRIPTION - This provides a description of the items

targeted by the reminder.

TARGET RESULT FINDINGS ITEM - This multiple is a variable pointer to the

specific items targeted by the reminder. For example, the targets for education

reminders can be selected from the education topics defined in the Education Topics

file. For immunization reminders, the targets can be selected from immunizations

defined in the Immunization file. See the distributed reminders for further

examples.

TARGET RESULT FOUND TEXT - If there is a record of the patient having

received the target item, for example a particular education topic, then the found

text will be passed to Health Summary for display.

TARGET RESULT NOT FOUND TEXT - If there is no record of the patient having

received the target item, then the Not Found Text will be passed to Health

Summary for display.

> **NOTE:** FOUND TEXT and NOT FOUND TEXT

Groups 3, 4, 6, 7 (AGE MATCH TEXT, AGE NO MATCH TEXT), and 10

contain FOUND TEXT and NOT FOUND TEXT entries.

Each of these entries is optional and will only be returned for display by Health

Summary if it is present.

TAXONOMY - This is a pointer to the TAXONOMY file. The taxonomy entries have

the form: low^high^file where low and high specify an inclusive range of applicable

codes and file is the number of the file where the codes are located. The file number

can be 80 (ICD diagnosis), 80.1 (ICD operation/procedure), or 81 (CPT).

Taxonomies are defined and given names which are used when setting up a

reminder.

MINIMUM AGE - If the patient is found to have this taxonomy, this minimum age

will override the baseline minimum age. If this is left blank, then the baseline

minimum age will apply. This provides a mechanism to change the age

requirements if a taxonomy is found. (See also Age Findings, Group 7.)

MAXIMUM AGE - This can override the baseline maximum age as with the

minimum age above. (See also Age Findings, Group 7.)

REMINDER FREQUENCY - This can override the baseline reminder frequency as

with the minimum age above. (See also Age Findings, Group 7.)

RANK FREQUENCY - If more than one taxonomy and/or Health Factor is found

for a patient and each of these has its own frequency age range set, then a question

arises concerning which one to use. Rank Frequency is used to answer the

question. The frequency age range set from the finding with the highest Rank

Frequency will be used. (The highest rank is 1.) If no ranking information is

available then the software will use the frequency age range set with the frequency

that will cause the reminder to be given most often.

USE IN DATE DUE CALC - This field can have the value YES, NO, or blank. If it

is YES then finding this taxonomy is equivalent to finding the target item. The

most recent date for any of the coded values found in the taxonomy will be used in

the Date Due calculation.

USE IN APPLY LOGIC - The field specifies how the taxonomy is to be used in the

Apply Logic, see Group 9. The allowed values are AND (&), OR (!), AND NOT (&’),

OR NOT (!’), and blank. When it is blank the taxonomy is not used in the Apply

Logic. When it contains one of the other values, which is a logical operator, it is

included in the Apply Logic preceded by the specified operator.

FOUND TEXT - This text will be returned for display by Health Summary if the

taxonomy is found.

NOT FOUND TEXT - This text will be returned for display by Health Summary if

the taxonomy is not found.

TAXON GENERAL FOUND TEXT - If any of the taxonomies are found then this

text will be returned for display by Health Summary.

TAXON GENERAL NOT FOUND TEXT - If none of the taxonomies are found then

this text will be returned for display by Health Summary.

HEALTH FACTOR - This is a pointer to the Health Factors file. Health factors

that are associated with the reminder are included this way.

MINIMUM AGE - Just as with taxonomy, this minimum age can override the

baseline minimum age if the Health Factor is found.

MAXIMUM AGE - The same as for the minimum age above.

REMINDER FREQUENCY - The same as for minimum age above.

RANK FREQUENCY - The same as for taxonomy, see Group 4.

USE IN DATE DUE CALC - The same as for taxonomy, see Group 4.

USE IN APPLY LOGIC - The same as for taxonomy, see Group 4.

FOUND TEXT - This text will be returned for display by Health Summary if the

Health Factor is found.

NOT FOUND TEXT - This text will be returned for display by Health Summary if

the Health Factor is not found.

HF GENERAL FOUND TEXT - If any of the health factors are found then this text

will be returned for display by Health Summary.

HF GENERAL NOT FOUND TEXT - If none of the health factors are found then

this text will be returned for display by Health Summary.

Age findings provides a way to change the reminder frequency based on a patient’s

age. The age ranges are searched and if the patient’s age lies between the minimum

and maximum age these become the baseline frequency age range set. (A frequency

age range set is a frequency and its associated minimum and maximum ages.)

There cannot be any overlap between the age ranges because this gives rise to a

conflict which cannot be resolved.

REMINDER FREQUENCY - The frequency to give the reminder. This is given as

nD, nM, or nY, where D stands for days, M for months, Y for years, and n is a

number. Thus, for a reminder that is to be given once a year, the values 365D, 12M,

or 1Y would all work. (This format is used for all time-related entries.) There are

two special reminder frequencies. The frequency 0Y means that the reminder is

never to be given. This is used to create reminders that are given only to patients

who have certain findings. For example the distributed VA-DIABETIC reminders

are setup up so they are given only to patients who have the VA-DIABETIC

taxonomy. The second special frequency is 99Y. This is used for reminders that are

to be given once in a lifetime.

MINIMUM AGE - The minimum age associated with this reminder frequency.

MAXIMUM AGE - The maximum age associated with this reminder frequency.

AGE MATCH TEXT - If the patient’s age lies in the specified age range, this text

will be returned for display by the Health Summary.

AGE NO MATCH TEXT - If the patient’s age does not lie in the specified age

range, this text will be returned for display by the Health Summary.

^PXD(811.9,D0,9)= (#9) APPLY LOGIC \[1F\] ^

APPLY LOGIC - This specifies how the findings for a reminder are to be used in

determining if the reminder is applicable for a patient. The findings consist of any

combination of computed findings, health factors, and taxonomies that are

included in the reminder definition.

The Apply Logic used in the reminder evaluation can be created in one of two ways.

If this field is left blank then the software will create an Apply Logic string starting

with a default string of (SEX)&(AGE) appending each finding that has a non-blank

Use in Apply Logic entry with the specified operator. As an example consider a

reminder that contains taxonomy number 28 with a Use in Apply Logic entry of &.

In this case the software will create an Apply Logic string of

(SEX)&(AGE)&(TF(28)).

The other alternative is to specify the Apply Logic directly in the reminder

definition. When this is done the software will use whatever is in the Apply Logic

field ignoring any Use in Apply Logic fields. If this alternative is used care must be

taken that the Apply Logic is written so that it will evaluate to a proper Mumps (M)

logical. In order to do this you need to understand how the Apply Logic is used.

The Apply Logic is based on the M Boolean logical operators, & (AND) , ! (OR) and

their negations &’ (AND NOT), !’ (OR NOT). The & operator requires both items to

be true in order to be true. The ! operator is true if either of the items is true. This is

easiest to understand by looking at some examples.

Consider reminder number X which has the following taxonomy entries:

^PXD(811.9,X,4,1,0)=7

^PXD(811.9,X,4,2,0)=11^40^75^6M^5^^^&

and the following health factor entries:

^PXD(811.9,X,6,1,0)=4^42^^1Y

^PXD(811.9,X,6,2,0)=9

The default logic, which is created automatically if the Apply Logic is left blank,

would be (SEX)&(AGE)&(TF(11)). SEX is evaluated if the reminder is sex-specific.

It is set to true if the patient is the correct sex. If the reminder is not sex-specific,

then SEX is always true. AGE is evaluated after the final frequency age range set

has been established. It is set to true if the patient’s age falls within the age range.

If there is no age range specified for the reminder then AGE is always true. TF(11)

stands for the taxonomy finding for taxonomy number 11. (Similarly HF stands for

health factor finding and CF for computed finding.) Thus the default logic says

that SEX, AGE, and TF(11) must all be true in order for the reminder to be

applicable. Since health factors 4 and 9 have a blank Use in Apply Logic field they

are not is not included in the Apply Logic and are used for information only.

If you require a more complex Apply Logic than the simple appending mechanism

of the Use in Apply Logic provides then you must include the Apply Logic in the

reminder definition. Some examples:

(SEX)&(AGE)&(HF(9)!(TF(7)) - the reminder is applicable if SEX and AGE and

either health factor 9 or taxonomy 7 is true (found).

(SEX)&(AGE)&’(HF(9)&TF(7)) - the reminder is applicable if SEX and AGE are

true and neither health factor 9 or taxonomy 7 is true.

The Reminder Inquiry option can be used to see the Apply Logic string in both the

numeric form and expanded form where the number is replaced by the name of the

finding. This can be used to make sure that the Apply Logic used in the reminder

evaluation is actually what you think it is.

At this point we can see that reminder definitions are very flexible and easily

customized. However, there may be cases where the requirements are not entirely

met by the mechanisms described above. In these cases, computed findings can be

used. Computed findings are M routines that return 1 for true and 0 for false. They

can be used in the logic just like taxonomies and health factors.

ROUTINE - The name of an M routine that will be executed. For obvious reasons,

only an experienced M programmer should attempt to create a computed factor

routine. Programming details are given in the section Writing a Computed Finding

Routine. This entry is specified in the form ENTRYPOINT;ROUTINE.

MINIMUM AGE - This is the minimum age associated with the computed finding

routine and can be used to override the baseline minimum age.

MAXIMUM AGE - This is the maximum age associated with the computed finding

routine and can be used to override the baseline maximum age.

REMINDER FREQUENCY - This is the reminder frequency associated with the

computed finding routine and can be used to override the baseline reminder

frequency.

SHORT DESCRIPTION - This field can be used to contain a short description of

what the Computed Finding does.

RANK FREQUENCY - The same as for taxonomies, see Group 4.

USE IN DATE DUE CALC - The same as for taxonomies, see Group 4.

USE IN APPLY LOGIC - The same as for taxonomies, see Group 4.

How is the final frequency age range set determined?

As we have seen, there can be a minimum age, maximum age, and frequency

associated with computed findings, health factors, and taxonomies that can

override the baseline values. The question is: How is the final set determined?

The baseline values are set from the data in Group 7. The age range in which the

patient’s age falls sets the minimum age, maximum age, and frequency. Leaving a

minimum age blank means that there is no minimum age for the reminder;

therefore, the patient will always meet the minimum age requirement. The same

holds true for maximum age.

Frequency is a different matter since a frequency is required to determine if a

reminder is due. A special frequency of 0Y means that FOUND, NOT FOUND

TEXT can be displayed, but the reminder can never come up as due, based on the

finding associated with the 0Y frequency. Only those findings with a frequency

greater than 0 can be used in the date due calculation. A frequency of 99Y can be

used for reminders that are due once in a lifetime.

Each taxonomy, health factor, or computed finding can have an associated

frequency age range set. If the finding is true¾i.e., the patient has the taxonomy,

health factor, etc.¾ the frequency age range set associated with the finding can

override the baseline values. Generally this is done to widen the coverage of the

reminder. For example, the VA-INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION is given once a

year to patients 65 and over. The baseline frequency age range set has a minimum

age of 65, no maximum age, and a frequency of 1Y. The VA-HIGH RISK FOR

FLU/PNEUMONIA taxonomy has no minimum age, maximum age, and a

frequency of 1Y. Thus, for patients who have this taxonomy, the baseline frequency

age range set is overridden and the reminder is applicable for all ages.

Rank Frequency field

In the case when there is more than one true finding and each has a frequency age

range set, a method is needed to determine which one to use. The Rank Frequency

field was added to meet this need. The frequency age range set with the highest

rank (1 being the highest) will be used. If there are no Rank Frequency values

available, then the frequency age range set that will cause the reminder to be given

most often will be used. For example, if one frequency was 1Y and the other 6M,

then 6M would be used since the reminder would be given every six months instead

of once a year.

Writing a Computed Finding Routine

A computed finding routine can be used in those cases when the general reminder

logic does not provide the required functionality. Computed finding routines should

be written as functions that return 1 for true and 0 for false. An example has been

provided with the VA-NUTRITION/OBESITY EDUCATION reminder. The

computed finding routine is PXRMOBES with entry point OBESE. This function

looks up the patient’s most recent height and weight measurements and then

calculates the body mass index. If the BMI is greater than 27 it returns 1, meaning

the patient is considered obese.

In addition to returning true or false, these functions may set INFO nodes of the

working array ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”). The information nodes have the format

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”INFO”,PXRMITEM,RNAME,DESCRIPTION)=TEXT

DESCRIPTION describes the type of information and TEXT is the information.

TEXT will be displayed by the Clinical Maintenance Component of Health

Summary. The routine should set DESCRIPTION and TEXT. The other indices are

already defined.

In PXRMOBES the INFO nodes are used to return information such as no height or

weight measurement available or to return the calculated value of the BMI.

Applicable Menu Options

The following menu options can be used to customize and develop new reminders:

> PXRM Reminder Copy,

> PXRM Reminder Edit,

> PXRM Taxonomy Copy,

> PXRM Taxonomy Edit,

> PXRM Reminder Test.

The easiest way to create a new reminder is to copy an existing one and then edit it.

Reminders that are distributed with PCE all begin with VA-. These are intended for

national distribution and cannot be edited by a site. When a reminder is copied the

user is prompted for a new unique name. A site cannot use the VA- prefix in their

reminder names.

PXRM REMINDER TEST

Before a new or modified reminder is put into production it should be thoroughly

checked. The Reminder Test option provides a convenient tool that can be used as

an aid in setting up new reminders and tracking down problems with existing ones.

It lets a reminder be run without going through Health Summary.

To get the most out of using this option you should be familiar with setting up a

reminder. This is explained in the Clinical Reminders portions of the PCE User

Manual. Relevant sections include Chapter 10 and Appendix A.

When this option is executed, it prompts the user for a patient and then areminder.*Sample output:*

The output from this option provides a view of the internal workings of the clinical

reminders software and allows you to see what happened as the reminder was

evaluated. Errors and warnings that are not always seen on the Health Summary

are displayed here. When setting up a reminder, it’s a good idea to have test

patients with known clinical data such as examinations, immunizations, ICDs,

CPTs, etc., that are pertinent to the reminder being developed. Using this option to

run the reminder for test patients allows you to see if the reminder operates as

expected.

Found and Not Found Text can be included in a number of places in the reminder

definition. An example is taxonomies. The Found Text will be displayed if the

taxonomy is found and the Not Found Text will be displayed if the taxonomy is not

found. This text is optional and should only be included if you want something

displayed.

The text should be chosen with care because it can give misleading information

within the total context of the findings. For example, consider a skin test reminder.

The reminders software searches the V Skin Test file and for a coded value if there

is a taxonomy. Confusion could arise if the taxonomy Not Found Text was “No skin

test found” and the reminders found an entry in the V Skin Test File but no match

on the taxonomy. The Health Summary would show the date of the skin test and

the message “No skin test found.” A less confusing Not Found Text would be “No

CPT for skin test found.” You should review your output to make sure that it

makes sense.

Output Explanations

An explanation of each piece of the \[PXRM REMINDER TEST\] output follows. This

explanation assumes that you are familiar with the various elements that comprise

a reminder definition.

Example 1

The elements of the ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”) array are: ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”1”)=The following disease screening, immunization and patient education^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”2”)=recommendations are offered as guidelines to assist in your practice. ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”3”)=These are only recommendations, not practice standards. The^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”4”)=appropriate utilization of these for your individual patient must be ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”5”)=based on clinical judgment and the patient's current status.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”) is a formatted array containing the disclaimer that is

displayed at the beginning of the Clinical Maintenance or Clinical Reminders

component of Health Summary.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”) is the working array used by the reminders software to

store data during processing. Examining this array provides detailed information

about what was found or not found during the reminder evaluation. The first three

subscripts “PXRM”,\$J,”WA” can be ignored, they just provide a unique storage area

in the computer’s memory. The remaining subscripts do contain useful information.

The entries seen in ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”, reflect what was found when the

reminder was evaluated for a specific patient. Therefore the subscripts seen and

the order they appear will vary.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”DUE”,”43”,”Diabetic Foot Exam”)=No Diabetic Foot Exam on record^2970304

The “DUE” subscript tells us the reminder is due, 43 is the reminder internal entry

number, and “Diabetic Foot Exam” is the name of the reminder. The text on the

right side of the equal sign tells us that no past diabetic foot exam was found and

the second piece is the date the reminder was run and will appear on the Health

Summary as the date due, i.e., the reminder is due on 3/4/97.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9PROB”,”28”,”CODE”)=250.01

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9PROB”,”28”,”DATE”)=2960926

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9PROB”,”28”,”ICD9IEN”)=851

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9PROB”,”28”,”PN”)=DIABETES MELLI W/0 COMP TYP I

This group of lines tells us that an ICD9 entry was found in the Problem List.

(Other file abbreviations for ICD9 entries are DGPT (Patient Treatment File), and

VPOV (V Purpose of Visit File)). The taxonomy containing this code was number

28\. The ICD9 code is 250.01, the date in FileMan format is 2960926, the ICD9

internal entry is 851 and the provider narrative is “DIABETES MELLI W/O COMP

TYP I”.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9VPOV”,”28”,”CODE”)=250.13

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9VPOV”,”28”,”DATE”)=2960918.09

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9VPOV”,”28”,”ICD9IEN”)=12830

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9VPOV”,”28”,”MOD”)=

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICD9VPOV”,”28”,”PN”)=DIABETES W/ KETOACIDOSIS,TYPE

I\[IDDM\]\[JUVENILE TYPE\],UNCONTROLLED

This group of lines tells us that an ICD9 entry was found in the V Purpose of Visit

file. The other entries are the same as in the previous group.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”INFO”,”43”,”Diabetic Foot Exam”,”VA-DIABETES_FOUNDB”)=Complete foot exam required annually for all diabetic patients.

This is the Found Text array as defined in the reminder. In this case the Found Text comes from taxonomy 28, “VA-DIABETES”.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”INFO”,”43”,”Diabetic Foot Exam”,”zFREQARNG”)=Final Frequency and Age Range used: 1 year for all ages.

This line tells us the final frequency and age range used in the date due calculation.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”LOGIC”)=1^(SEX)&(AGE)&(TF(28))^(1)&(1)&(1)

This line is one of the most important in the output. It gives all the information

concerning the APPLY LOGIC. There are three pieces separated by ^. The second

piece is the APPLY LOGIC string used to determine if the reminder should be

given. In order for the reminder to be given, SEX, AGE, and taxonomy finding 28,

TF(28), all have to be true. In this case, the taxonomy finding was true because one

of the codes in the taxonomy was found in the patient’s clinical data. The third

piece shows us the outcome of the finding evaluation; in this example they are all

true. (True is represented by 1 and false by 0.) The first piece is the logical

evaluation of the third piece. In this case, the APPLY LOGIC evaluates to true, so

the reminder will be given. When the APPLY LOGIC evaluates to false, the

reminder is Not Applicable, N/A.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”RANK”,”0”,”365.04”,”0”,”0”)=TFIND^28

This line gives information about the ranking process used to determine the final

frequency age range set. The subscript immediately following “RANK” is the rank

value. When no rank value has been defined in the reminder, the value will be “0”.

For this example, there is no “rank” so we determine the frequency age range set to

use based on the frequency which causes the reminder to be given the most often.

The “365.04” is the conversion of the final frequency, one year (1Y) to days. The

smallest value of frequency in days is the one that will cause the reminder to be

given most often. The two subscripts following the frequency correspond to

minimum age and maximum age. A value of “0” for these subscripts has special

significance -- it means that there is no minimum or no maximum age. The value on

the right side of the equal sign indicates that this frequency came from a taxonomy

finding (TFIND) and the internal entry number of the taxonomy was 28.

The elements of the ^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J) array are:

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”43”,”Diabetic Foot Exam”)=DUE NOW^2970304^unknown

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”43”,”Diabetic Foot Exam”,”TXT”,”1”)=9/26/96 Problem Diagnosis: 250.01-DIABETES MELLI W/0 COMP TYP I^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”43”,”Diabetic Foot Exam”,”TXT”,”2”)=9/18/96 Encounter Diagnosis: 250.13-DIABETES W/KETOACID. TYPE I

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”43”,”Diabetic Foot Exam”,”TXT”,”3”)=Complete foot exam required annually for all diabetic patients.^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”43”,”Diabetic Foot Exam”,”TXT”,”4”)=Final Frequency and Age Range used: 1 year for all ages.

The ^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J) array is the final information that is passed to Health

Summary for display. The output in the Health Summary will reformat the date

into an external format, display it, and then display the text lines.

Example 2

Select Patient: PCEPATIENT,ONE 04-01-44 000456789 YES SC

VETERAN

Select Reminder: VA-MAMMOGRAM

This is our input to the option.

The elements of the ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”) array are:

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”1”)=The following disease screening, immunization and patient education ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”2”)=recommendations are offered as guidelines to assist in your practice. ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”3”)=These are only recommendations, not practice standards. The ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”4”)= appropriate utilization of these for your individual patient must be ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”DISC”,”5”)=based on clinical judgment and the patient's current status.

This is the reminder disclaimer.

The elements of the ^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”) array are:

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”AF_FNF”,”2”)=AF 2 FOUND

The “AF_FNF” subscript corresponds to Age Finding Found Not Found information.

There was a match between the patient’s age and Baseline Age Finding number 2.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”HF”,”43”,”DATE”)=2960429

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”HF”,”43”,”FREQ”)=

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”HF”,”43”,”MAXAGE”)=

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”HF”,”43”,”MINAGE”)=

This group of lines provides Health Factor information. The Health Factor with

internal entry number 43 was found and the date was 2960429. There was no

frequency or age range associated with this Health Factor.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICPT”,”16”,”CODE”)=76092

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICPT”,”16”,”DATE”)=2970221.142333

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICPT”,”16”,”ICPTIEN”)=76092

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICPT”,”16”,”PN”)=MAMM0GRAM, SCREENING

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”ICPT”,”16”,”SNAME”)=MAMM0GRAM, SCREENING

This group of lines tells us that CPT information was found. The CPT code was

76092 and it came from taxonomy 16. The date was 2970221, the CPT file internal

entry number was 76092, the provider narrative from the V CPT file was

“MAMMOGRAM, SCREENING,” and the CPT short name from the CPT file was

“MAMMOGRAM, SCREENING.”

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”INFO”,”19”,”Mammogram”,”AF 2 FOUNDB”)=Women ages 50-69 should receive a mammogram every two years.

This is Found Text for the Age Finding 2 defined in the reminder.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”INFO”,”19”,”Mammogram”,”HFC1”)=Health Factor comments: Activate health factor comments

This is a Health Factor comment from the patient’ s V Health Factor findings.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”INFO”,”19”,”Mammogram”,”VA-BREAST TUMOR NOT_FOUNDB”)=No history of breast cancer/tumor on file.

This is Not Found Text for taxonomy 19.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”INFO”,”19”,”Mammogram”,”WARNING”,”TAX”)=Taxonomy 18 entry V10.3^V10.3 does not have a source file, assuming file 80.

This is warning information and it will not be displayed on the Health Summary.

The text is self-explanatory once you remember that a taxonomy entry requires a

low coded value, a high coded value, and a source file.

This entry in taxonomy 18 has a low coded value of V10.3, a high coded value of

V10.3 and the source file is missing. To process the reminder a source file is

required. In order to continue, the reminder’s logic assumes that it is file 80, the

ICD diagnosis file. If you really wanted the CPT or ICD operation/procedures file

then you should change the taxonomy.

Some other warnings you might see:

“Warning no reminder frequency, cannot calculate date due!”

This means the reminders software was not able to establish a frequency. Most

likely, it was left out of the Baseline Age Findings.

“Warning no do in advance time”

There was no do in advance time in the reminder definition, the reminders software

will use 0 in the date due calculation.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”INFO”,”19”,”Mammogram”,”zFREQARNG”)=Final Frequency and Age Range used: 2 years for ages 50 to 69.

This is the final frequency and age range information used in the date due

calculation. This comes from the rank and frequency evaluation discussed above.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”LOGIC”)=1^(SEX)&(AGE)&'(HF(42))^(1)&(1)&'(0)

This is the APPLY LOGIC string and provides an example of how the INACTIVATE Health Factors work. The INACTIVATE Health Factor for this reminder is HF(42) so the logical operator is &’. We can see this reminder has not been inactivated for this patient because HF(42) is false. SEX and AGE are true, so the entire APPLY LOGIC string evaluates to true; therefore the reminder will be given.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”NOTDUE”,”19”,”Mammogram”)=Mammogram due on^2990221.142333^2970221.142333

This tells that the reminder is not due. It is due on 2990221 and was last given on

2970221\.

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”RAD”,”436”,”CPT”)=76091

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”RAD”,”436”,”DATE”)=2960826

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”RAD”,”436”,”NAME”)=MAMMOGRAM BILAT

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”RAD”,”436”,”SNAME”)=MAMMOGRAM, BOTH BREASTS

These lines tell us that radiology information was found. The number 436 is the

radiology procedure pointer. The CPT code is 76091, the date of the procedure is

2960826, the name of the radiology procedure is “MAMMOGRAM BILAT,” and the

CPT short name is “MAMMOGRAM, BOTH BREASTS.”

^TMP(“PXRM”,\$J,”WA”,”RDATE”,”2970221.142333”)=TFDATE^16

This line tells that the date used in the date due calculation was 2970221 and that

it came from a taxonomy finding for taxonomy number 16. Notice that this date is

more recent than the date of the radiology procedure. This is an example of how

the Use in Date Due Calc field works.

The elements of the ^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J) array are:

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”19”,”Mammogram”)=^2990221.142333^2970221.142333

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”19”,”Mammogram”,”TXT”,”1”)=4/29/96 Health Factor: ACTIVATE BREAST CANCER SCREEN

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”19”,”Mammogram”,”TXT”,”2”)=2/21/97 Encounter Procedure: 76092-MAMM0GRAM, SCREENING

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”19”,”Mammogram”,”TXT”,”3”)=Women ages 50-69 should receive

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”19”,”Mammogram”,”TXT”,”5”)=No history of breast cancer/tumor on file. ^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”19”,”Mammogram”,”TXT”,”6”)=Final Frequency and Age Range used: 2 years for ages 50 to 69. ^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”19”,”Mammogram”,”TXT”,”7”)=8/26/96

Radiology Procedure: 76091-MAMMOGRAM, BOTH BREASTS; MAMMOGRAM

^TMP(“PXRHM”,\$J,”19”,”Mammogram”,”TXT”,”8”)=BILAT

Finally, this is the information as it is returned to Health Summary.

VA-\*COLORECTAL CANCER SCREEN (FOBT)-----------------------------------

Reminder Type: EXAMINATION

Print Name: Fecal Occult Blood Test

Related VA-\* Reminder: VA-\*COLORECTAL CANCER SCREEN (FOBT)

Reminder Description:

> Fecal occult blood test due every year for patients ages 50 and older, or

> 5 years after the last Sigmoidoscopy. The 5 years is a conservative

> period recommended by a blue ribbon panel publishing their findings in

> the February 1997 issue of "Gastroenterology" magazine.

> This VA-\*COLORECTAL CANCER SCREEN - FOBT reminder is based on the

> "Colorectal Cancer Detection" guidelines specified in the VHA HANDBOOK

> 1101.8, APPENDIX A.

> Target Condition: Early detection of colon cancer or its predecessors.

> Target Group: All persons ages 50 and older.

> Recommendation: All persons age 50 and older should receive an annual

> fecal occult blood test or undergo a sigmoidoscopy examination

> (periodicity unspecified).

> Goals for FY 2000: For persons age 50 and older: 50 percent of those

> enrolled in primary care clinics have received fecal occult blood

> testing within the preceding year and 40 percent have received at

> least one proctosigmoidoscopy examination in their lifetime.

Technical Description:

> This reminder is based on Taxonomy Findings from FOBT, "or" SIG cancer

> screening, "and" FOBT exam results recorded from a clinic encounter as an

> EXAM. See the definition for VA-\*COLORECTAL CANCER SCREEN (SIG.) also.

> These two reminders work together for assessing cancer screening.

> The FOBT is due annually, unless a SIG is found. The SIG found changes

> the frequency to due once in a lifetime (99Y) according to the M-2

> document, but a more conservative approach is encouraged by the National

> Center for Health Promotion to use 5 years (5Y). The SIG found changes

> the frequency to due every 5 years for patients 50 and older (note the

> rank of 2). After a SIG has been received by the patient, if the

> clinician determines the FOBT should be given to this patient again

> annually, the FOBT can be activated again by entering the Health Factor

> "ACTIVATE FOBT CANCER SCREEN" for the patient (Note the rank of 1).

> Check the Taxonomy Findings entries representing Fecal Occult Blood Test

> and VA-FLEXISIGMOIDOSCOPY. The taxonomies represent coded standard

> entries in the CPT file and ICD Operation/Procedure file. If one of

> these taxonomies need modification, copy the taxonomy to a new taxonomy

> for your site, and make the appropriate modifications. THAN, copy the

> reminder to a new reminder to add your local sites modifications.

> This reminder cannot make use of the Laboratory package data at this time

> because the Occult Blood results are Microbiology tests that do not

> reflect the Laboratory Test done, or the related CPT code.

Reminder Description:

> At least one sigmoidoscopy examination in their lifetime for patients age

> 50 and older, or a fecal occult blood test yearly. This reminder uses 5

> years, rather than 99Y for "ONCE" as originally published in the VA

> Guidelines. The 5 years is a conservative period recommended by a blue

> "Gastroenterology" magazine.

> This reminder is based on the "Colorectal Cancer Detection" guidelines

> Target Group: All persons ages 50 and older.

> Recommendation: All persons age 50 and older should receive an annual

> enrolled in primary care clinics have received fecal occult blood

> testing within the preceding year and 40 percent have received at

> least one proctosigmoidoscopy examination in their lifetime.

Technical Description:

> The next time a SIG is due is 1 year from the last FOBT, or 5 years from

> the last SIG.

> The reminder type is EXAM, and the Baseline AGE RANGE and FREQUENCY is 50 and older and 1Y - so that the SIG will be due a year from the last FOBT done in the clinic. The AGE RANGE and FREQUENCY are modified to 50 and older and 5Y if a prior SIG has been received by the patient. The Rank of 2, on the VA-FLEXISIGMOIDOSCOPY taxonomy match fields, will cause a match of a SIG to take precedence over the FOBT findings to establish when the SIG is due again. If the most recent health factor finding, between INACTIVATE and ACTIVATE is INACTIVATE with its rank of 1, the reminder will be "N/A" (not applicable to the patient), and the frequency is 0Y.

> Check the Taxonomy Findings entries representing flexisigmoidoscopy and

> FOBT procedures. This represents coded standard entries in the CPT file

> and ICD Operation/Procedure file. If the taxonomies need modification,

> copy the taxonomy to a new taxonomy for your site, and make the

> appropriate modifications. Then, copy this reminder to a new reminder

> for your local sites modifications, and change the Taxonomy Findings to

# Appendix B - Orientation of MAS Users to PCE

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Orient your MAS users to changes in their Appointment Management and Disposition functionality resulting from PCE/Scheduling integration.

Dispositions

Create a DISPOSITION CLINIC for each division in your facility using the "Set Up a Clinic" option on the Scheduling Supervisor Menu.

- If you are a multi-divisional facility and you want to credit disposition workload for each division, set up a DISPOSITION CLINIC for each division. Make sure you define each DISPOSITION CLINIC so that it is easily associated with the division for which you want to credit workload.
- If you are a single-division facility, you should define only one DISPOSITION CLINIC.
- The DISPOSITION CLINICS are *only* used with Dispositions.
- PCE recommends creating a clinic defined as Disposition, with a Stop Code number of 102. This clinic should be used with all dispositions.
- Use "PCE Edit Disposition Clinics" option located on the "PCE Site Parameter Menu" to enter the DISPOSITION CLINICs defined for use with Dispositions for your facility. The purpose of this is to restrict the Hospital Location for a Disposition to DISPOSITION CLINICs only.
- In single-division facilities, the hospital location for Dispositions will be stuffed automatically, and you will not be prompted to select a DISPOSITION HOSPITAL LOCATION.

*PCE Edit Disposition Clinics Example*

Checkout and Add/Edit on the Appointment Manager menu have been changed by PCE to comply with new requirements that every encounter must have a provider, diagnosis, and procedure associated with it. You will still enter the checkout information through the same menu and options, but the appearance on your computer screen changes when you get to the prompts relating to the new requirements.

You are prompted to enter Provider, Service-connection status, Diagnosis (and designate a primary diagnosis), and Procedure (or CPT codes). You may also specify if the Diagnosis is added to the patient's Problem List.

A provider key isn't required for the providers entered here.

REMEMBER: Entering one or two question marks provides help (including lists of acceptable CPT codes, Diagnoses, and Stop Codes) on how to respond to prompts.
