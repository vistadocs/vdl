The Vitals/Measurements application is designed to store in the patient's electronic medical record all vital signs and various measurements associated with a patient's hospital stay or outpatient clinic visit. Data can be accessed by several V*IST*A (Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture) applications (e.g., CPRS, Health Summary) that interface with the Vitals/Measurements application.

## Functionality[^1]

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

• Contains a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to make editing and viewing of data easier. Additional information on GUI software is contained at the end of this chapter.

> • Supports documentation of a patient's vital signs (e.g., temperature, pulse, and respiration).

> • Tracks a patient's height, weight, central venous pressure (CVP), circumference/girth and oxygen saturation via oximetry with supplemental oxygen information.

> • Supports documentation of detailed or positional blood pressures for a patient (i.e., bilateral blood pressures taken in a sitting, standing and lying position).

> • Associates qualifiers (alpha characters appended to the measurement's numeric value) to provide a more detailed description of the patient's vitals/measurements.

> • Contains detailed help windows to assist users in associating appropriate qualifiers with the patient vitals/measurements.

> • Prints temperature, height, and weight in both metric equivalents and U.S. customary units.

> • Prints patient's cumulative measurements on the Vitals Signs Record and the Cumulative Vitals Report.

> • Displays latest information on all of the patient's vitals/measurements in both metric equivalents and U.S. customary units (when appropriate) along with the date/time the information was obtained.

> • The displays include the patient's intake and output when present in the patient's database (refer to the Intake and Output application).

> • Allows facilities to establish hospital-wide high and low values for each vital sign or measurement.

> • Identifies abnormal patient values on vitals/measurements reports (those values outside the high and low range).

> • Displays graphic reports on workstation monitors.

> • Provides APIs so other VistA applications can send or receive patient data.

> • Records a reason for the omission of a patient's vitals/measurements.

> • Supports an interface to vital signs monitor connected to the workstation.

## Information on GUI software

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Internet WWW Documentation

Documentation for this product (including user manual, technical manual and package security guide, release notes, and installation guide) is available on the Internet (World Wide Web) from the [VHA Software Document Library (VDL)](http://www.va.gov/vdl/) \<http://www.va.gov/vdl/\>:

GUI and Windows

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface, most frequently seen as the Windows screen. If you have already used programs with these screens, then the Vitals GUI screen will seem familiar to you. The Vitals GUI is only implemented on the Microsoft Windows platform at this time.

If you have little or no familiarity with Windows, you can browse through the Windows help file for information about the basics of using Windows. Also, see the next few paragraphs for brief descriptions of some GUI features.

> To access the Windows Help File, click the Start button in the taskbar and click Help. Use this help file as a reference whenever you have general questions about Windows.

> The following is an example of what a GUI screen looks like (Fig. 1-1):

![Fig. 1-1

Windows](vitals-version-5-technical-manual-and-package-security-guide/002.png)

*Fig. 1-1

Windows*

An “application window” is the area on your computer screen used by a program. If you have more than one program running at the same time, you can go from one program to another by clicking in each application window. The currently active window contains a colored bar (usually blue) at the top of the window. An inactive window contains a gray bar at the top of the window. You can also move, close, or minimize the application window to make room for another window. (See Help in Windows for further instructions on these functions.)

Inactive window Active window

Fig. 1-2[^3]

Pop-up Windows

These are “mini” windows that pop up within a window to provide or request information. Usually they require some action before they will go away. Clicking on buttons with the words \<Cancel\>, \<Exit\>, or something similar closes these windows.

Menus

Menus are shown in the gray bar near the top of the window. Some examples of menus are: File, Edit, Reports, and Help — typical menus for most Windows applications. When you click on one of these, a list of options is displayed.

> Help

> Online help and documentation are available in several formats: hints, context-sensitive help, menu help, and Internet Web documentation.

> Hints

> Place the cursor over a specific button, and a pop-up box will appear containing a short description of that button.

> Context-Sensitive Help

Use the “F1” key at any time to obtain help on the current screen.

> Menu Help

> Select the Help Menu at the top of the screen. A Table of Contents opens. Choose one of the contents, or type in a topic you want help on. A screen appears containing help about that subject.

> Access Keys

> Use access keys to quickly get to an option through the pull-down menus by holding down the Alt key and pressing the underlined letter of the desired pull-down menu, then (still holding down the Alt key) press the underlined letter of the desired option.

# Implementation and Maintenance

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This chapter provides guidelines for implementing the Vitals/Measurements application. It is important to complete all of the steps contained in this chapter before assigning menu options to clinical staff.

## Virgin Installation of Software

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following steps should be followed when the Vitals/Measurements software is installed in an environment where no previous installation of the Vitals/Measurements application has taken place.

1\. Setting up the software environment.

Information Resource Management Services (IRMS) staff should install the software using the Installation Guide in a test environment prior to installing the software in the production (VAH) account. The following V*IST*A packages should reside in the environment where the Vitals/Measurements application is to be installed:

> a\. VA FileMan V. 22 or greater,

> b\. Kernel V. 8.0 or greater,

> c\. Kernel Toolkit V. 7.3 or greater,

> d\. Kernel RPC Broker V. 1.1 or greater,

> e\. PIMS V. 5.3 or greater,

> f\. Intake and Output V. 4.0,

> g Health Summary V. 2.7 or greater,

> h\. Nursing V. 4.0 or greater.

Data entered into the test environment CANNOT be transferred into the production environment. It is recommended that a limited amount of data be entered into the test directory in order for the user to become familiar with the application and to establish an acceptable training database.

2\. Name spacing and file listing.

Vitals/Measurements is found in the GMV namespace. All routines, templates and options begin with GMV. File numbers are in the range of 120.5 to 120.57 and are stored in the ^GMR and ^GMRD globals.

3\. Editing site configurable files.

Site configurable files can be edited through the Vitals Manager module.

4\. Queuing TaskMan jobs.

No queued TaskMan jobs are associated with this application.

5\. [^4]Accessing modules.

The Vitals application, i.e., the Vitals and Vitals Manager modules are accessed separately through the GUI executable icons on the user’s desktop. The Vitals module is assigned to the clinical staff so they can use the Vitals application, and the Vitals Manager module is assigned to the Clinical Application Coordinator, package coordinator, and Information Resource Management Service (IRMS) staff so they can use the Vitals Manager application to manage the Vitals templates and abnormal values.

6\. Assigning modules.

The Vitals Manager module should be assigned to Clinical Application Coordinator, package coordinator, and Information Resource Management Service (IRMS) staff.

The Vitals module should be assigned to clinical staff.

7\. Security keys.

There is one security key in this application, it is GMV MANAGER. This new key allows a user to view/create/edit all other user’s templates in the Vitals Manager module, without this key the user can only view/create/edit his/her own user templates. This key also allows a user to use (run) other user’s templates in the Vitals application. This key should be assigned to the package coordinator.

8\. Printer issues.

Users may print some reports on Client (Windows) printers and other reports on V*IST*A (device file) printers.

9\. On-line Help.

Throughout the application, on-line help is available when questions arise. The user can click on the Help button or menu at the top of the screen to see a table of contents and index containing help on how to enter data, print reports, etc..

## Non-Virgin Installation of Software

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Follow steps 1 through 9 above when installing the software in an environment where a previous version of the application has been installed.

## [^5]Implementation Considerations

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Some sites prefer to delay implementation of the software until they have a point of care data entry system, but this software can be implemented without a point of care system. Vital sign entry can be accomplished by ancillary service personnel, (e.g., PIMS, Dietetics, Pharmacy). Interested users of this software are encouraged to form a committee to work cooperatively on the implementation and training of the package. Setting up test wards is a good way to begin a cooperative implementation effort. The Vitals/Measurements module is appropriate for all personnel who obtain and record patient vitals/measurements. Conceivably this module could be used by nursing, dietetics, medicine, and other disciplines as appropriate.

## Resource Requirements

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The minimal hardware requirements for the software are two data input devices (usually PC workstations running Windows 9x or NT (Ver. 4 or later)) and one printer per location. 12 megabytes of available memory is needed to run the program. The following statistics regarding the disk storage requirements of the software were compiled by an average test site.

### Server Requirements

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Delphi Components

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

[^8]Vitals/Measurements uses RPC Broker and VA FileMan Delphi Components in the display and navigation of screens. Vitals utilizes only the standard components as supplied with Delphi.

Below is a list of the Delphi components this application currently uses along with a short description.

TeeChart Displays charts and graphs. It is used in Vitals/Measurements to graphically plot various measurements versus time.

ResizerPanel Resizes its client components when the form is resized or the screen resolution is changed. This takes care of proper size and position of components with regard to the font size used in Windows. It is there so users can resize the application Windows to meet their needs.

VersionInfoResource Retrieves VERSIONINFO data from the executable. It is used in the about boxes in Vitals/Measurements to display version information.

RPCBroker Used for all non-FTP communication with the server.

FMDC Used for saving, deleting, validating, and retrieving data in FileMan data dictionaries.

DateTime Allows the user to visually select a date and time. It is provided as an option on all date/time fields.

PatientSelectionFrame Allows user to select a patient, by unit, team, ward, clinic or name. The frame is on a resize panel.

ReportFrame Allows users to view patients vitals data and create a configurable graph of data.

This table contains a list of parameter settings used by the Vitals/Measurement Standalone and Vitals Lite Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

> **NOTE:** The GUIs use these parameter settings to start the software. When a GUI is open and the user changes the settings (e.g., checks a checkbox) that change works immediately in the GUI, but the parameter setting is not saved to the server until the user exits the GUI. If you are trying to debug a problem and have a GUI and a Mumps session open with the parameter settings showing at the same time, you will not see the parameter settings change until you close the GUI.

How can you see these parameter settings on the server?

Example:
