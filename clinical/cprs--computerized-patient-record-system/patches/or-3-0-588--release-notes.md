The following sections provide a summary of the new features and functions, enhancements and modifications to the existing software, and any known issues for CPRS GUI v32c.

## New Features and Functions Added

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This section describes the new functionality added to the CPRS GUI v32c release.

### CPRS Write Access Functionality

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

CPRS Write Access functionality enables an authorized VistA user to permit or restrict write access for each CPRS tab (Problems, Meds, Orders, Notes, Consults, Surgery and Discharge Summary), and for specific functionality within each tab (for example, Cover Sheet Vitals, Encounters and specific Ordering Display Groups).

CPRS Write Access functionality eases the transition from CPRS/VistA to the new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. It ensures continuity of patient care and optimizes validation of data displayed in the new EHR. Write Access functionality exists because Sites transitioning to the new EHR must limit unauthorized write-access in CPRS and VistA. However, sites that have not yet moved to the new EHR can still restrict Write Access to specific areas of CPRS at the system level, or for individual users or divisions.

Details of this enhancement:

- Write Access restrictions only impact CPRS. Downstream applications that interface with CPRS/VistA are not impacted.
- New VistA Parameters have been created to enable/restrict write access to each CPRS tab:
  - The new parameters can be set at the Package, System, Division and User Levels.
    - They allow an authorized user to set the entire chart to “read only”, which enables read capability but restricts write access.
    - A user may restrict/enable specific tab functionality such as orders, based on Display Group Name (e.g., Inpatient Medications, Outpatient Pharmacy, Blood Bank).
    - If a restricted orderable is selected, an error message will display, based on the CPRS Write Access Error Message definition.
- A new menu option, CPRS Write Access Menu, has been added to the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) Menu Option. These menu options manage the new parameters:
  - LV CPRS Write Access Display
  - EP CPRS Write Access Editor
  - CP CPRS Write Access Copy User Settings
  - RS CPRS Write Access Remove Settings
  - VU CPRS Write Access View Single User Settings
- Access to View Alerts will be available in VistA. If a site has transitioned to the new EHR:
  - A user will be able to process all alerts in VistA except the ones for TIU and Orders.
  - A user will be able to process all alerts on the CPRS GUI if they have the appropriate Write Access Permissions. For example, a user who does not have Write Access permission for Orders will not be able to process Orders alerts.
- If the Write Access settings have changed in VistA, the CPRS GUI must be restarted before those updates will take effect.
- A new CPRS GUI screen, Write Access Permission, lists the tabs and additional functionality where write access is allowed. A user can view the Write Access Permission screen by clicking on the Help menu or New EHR Banner.
- If an organization has migrated to a new EHR, the COVID-19 Identifier banner will be repurposed as a New EHR banner, and will look like the example below:  
    
  ![](or-3-0-588-release-notes-cprs-v32c/002.png)
- The CPRS VistA List Manager will be disabled after a site migrates to a new eR EHR.
- A new option, EHR Orders Transition Report, will list orders that can be acted on.
- The PDMP Button on the CPRS “ribbon” bar can no longer be disabled.

### WebView2Loader.dll

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

CPRS GUI v32c now includes a new file, WebView2Loader.dll v1.0.1462.37. Because Microsoft Edge has replaced Internet Explorer as the default web browser, updates have been made to provide a consistent user experience when opening and using the Consult Toolbox (CTB) application from within CPRS GUI. The loader DLL assists applications with invoking the WebView2 runtime environment. This file, which will be reviewed and updated to newer versions as required, will be part of the CPRS GUI distribution going forward.

## Defect Tracking System Items

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1.  I9000178FY16- Service hierarchy problem

Problem: User states in CPRS when they go to view and try and view by service, it

does not let you view by service.

Resolution: The CPRS GUI was modified to correctly populate the consult service list

hierarchy.

2.  INC000001236287 - Inpatient Medications - Complex Order Issue

Problem: When a user tries to discontinue part of a complex order, and one part of the order (child or parent) is locked in Pharmacy, CPRS will allow the user to Discontinue the parts of the order that are NOT locked, leaving the one that was still valid.

Resolution: Added code that will prevent the cancelation of associated orders if one of

the other associated orders is currently locked.

3.  INC R10433527FY16 - PATIENT CARE ENCOUNTERS, historical visit prompts for primary provider erroneously.

Problem: Notes entered for an encounter, where the notes included a reminder dialog, were prompting for a primacy provider even when the note template had been set to suppress that. Notes that don’t include a reminder don’t have this issue. This was found to be true whether the note was for a historical encounter or a current one.

Resolution: After the user clicks on the “Finish” button for the reminder dialog, but before they are asked if they are the primary provider, CPRS checks if SUPPRESS DX/CPT ON ENTRY is set (Yes) for that note.

4.  I15588508FY17 - Error entering delayed orders while patient is admitted

Problem: If the patient is admitted while entering delayed orders for that patient in CPRS, errors will occur that shut CPRS down. The user receives a warning message that the patient has been admitted, then is presented with a question if they want to continue adding new orders. Both choices lead to access violation errors that will cause CPRS to close.

Resolution: When CPRS detects the completed admission while entering orders, it resets

the delayed event type to the proper code ('C', for current/no longer delayed) instead of a null character (#0, which will crash the RPC broker).

5.  R18218636FY18 - User states that no one in the Pharmacy can access this one patient file in CPRS, shows locked

Problem: When a patient has a DFN with a decimal point (".") in it, their demographic information cannot be viewed in CPRS.

Resolution: In CPRS, before the demographics form was displayed, the patient's DFN was converted from a string to a 64-bit integer. Since the DFN had a decimal point, it was not a valid integer, which caused the form not to be displayed. The code was changed to convert the DFN string a floating-point number. The point of the conversion is to verify that the DFN wasn't blank, zero, or negative.

6.  I9836510FY16 - BL: Text Integration Utility - Other

Problem: When a provider creates a discharge summary for which he is also the attending physician, when he attempts to sign the discharge, he is shown the warning: "Author has not signed, are you SURE you want to sign?"

Resolution: If the author (dictator) and attending are the same as the provider attempting to sign the discharge summary, do not check to see if the author has signed yet (he hasn't) and do not show this warning.

7.  I7509280FY16 - SAM: CPRS - Lab Collect Order entered after cut off time

Problem: The provider didn't select a collection date/time from the drop-down list. Instead, they entered a collection date/time that was technically valid and in the future. However, the cutoff time for that collection had already passed and the provider was given no warning.

Resolution: If a date/time for collection is entered for which the cutoff time has already passed, CPRS will not allow the entry and provide this message to the user: "The cutoff time has passed for the selected lab collection time. Choose another collection time."

8.  <span id="I9926255FY16" class="anchor"></span>I9926255FY16 - Meds not viewable in orders tab

Problem: When transferring an outpatient medication to inpatient with a manual release action, the order no longer shows up on the Orders tab.

Resolution: The CPRS GUI was updated to correctly transfer these orders over when performing a manual release action.

9.  INC19398646 9/3 notes JAWS issue

Problem: In the meds tab of CPRS, when searching for a new medication, JAWS is not able to read anything from the list. it's completely visually inaccessible.

Resolution: The CPRS GUI was updated to correct JAWS's ability to read the list.

10. INC21075957 CPRS hover feature is not accessible

Problem: CPRS is using a hover feature to show whether patients are registered in My HealtheVet to send Secure Messages. If you hover over the My HealtheVet button, it will turn blue if they are registered. For JAWS users, the button just isn't available, but I have to tab over 10 times to determine whether the button is there or not. There is simply no way to know this unless one knows the exact location of this button in the tab order. Original problem was entered in as a request \#REQ6354081.

Resolution: The CPRS GUI was updated to correct handling of the hover feature.

11. INC24901775 CPRS V32B :User is not able to print on CPRS

Problem: When Printing a consult SF513 to a network printer an erroneous error message "0^Queued as task \#" is displayed. While this error did not actually affect/stop printing, its appearance created confusion for users.

Resolution: This erroneous error message has been removed.

12. INC26701552 Error message when starting new note (duplicates: INC26651638, INC26613580 and INC26629746)

    Problem: After OR\*3.0\*598 was released, creating a new note in CPRS with an attached Reminder Dialog template would cause an access violation, preventing the opening of the template.

    Resolution: The CPRS GUI was updated to correctly create the dialog without an access violation.
13. <span id="INC26523979" class="anchor"></span>INC26523979 - RELATED TO THE REPORTED CPRS Pt Record Flag (PRF) Error - Pt Safety Alert N23-01 ISSUE, FURTHER OCCURENCES - HITPS-10039.

    Problem: A CPRS GUI user selected a flagged patient and the correct patient record flag displayed. That same user highlighted another flagged patient from the Patient Selection screen but clicked the Cancel button. The patient record for the first flagged patient still displayed. However, the patient record flag displayed the flag data of the highlighted but unselected patient.

    Resolution: The patient record flag displays the correct flag data.
14. <span id="INC25144966" class="anchor"></span>INC25144966 – Email links not opening Outlook for some users

    Problem: CPRS GUI templates may contain mailto links. It was reported in CPRS v32b that, for some users, mailto links no longer open in Outlook. For some users, the mailto link will first open Edge browser, and then open a new Outlook message. For other users, the mailto link only opens Edge, a new Outlook message is never opened.

    Resolution: The tool being used to honor mailto links was modified. According to Microsoft, the function previously used was altered/unavailable in subsequent versions of the operating system or product.
15. <span id="INC25242144" class="anchor"></span>INC25242144 – Template Editor up and down arrows can be hidden

    Problem: After the installation of CPRS v32b, the up and down arrow buttons in the template editor are grayed out when the font is set to 10.

    Resolution: The template editor was modified in the CPRS GUI to properly display the arrows when fonts are adjusted.
16. <span id="unable_to_park" class="anchor"></span>Unable to Park supply orders on the Orders tab.

    Problem: Users were unable to park supply orders when working on the Orders tab, even though Park was enabled.

    Resolution: Updated functionality on the Orders tab to allow supply orders to be parked.

## Known Issues

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

CPRS v32c does not have any known issues.

# New Parameters

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

CPRS v32c has several new parameters.

## CPRS Parameters

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- OR CPRS ORDERS WRITE ACCESS: This parameter allows a site to control whether or not a user, a division, or the entire system (site) is allowed to write orders by assigning write privilege by order display groups. This parameter is only evaluated if the user has access to the Orders tab based on the parameter settings in the parameter OR CPRS TABS WRITE ACCESS. The parameter also has a package level but it should not be set by the site.  
    
  If the display group parameter is defined at a higher precedence level, the value will be passed down to the lower level if a lower level does not overwrite it.
- OR CPRS OTHER WRITE ACCESS –This parameter allows the site to control the CPRS write access for some miscellaneous functions. The control can be at the user, division, or system (site). The functions that can be defined are: A for Allergies, D for Delayed Orders, E for Encounters, I for Immunizations, R for the Reminder Editor, and W for Women's Health. The parameter also has a package level but this should not be set by the site.
- OR CPRS TABS WRITE ACCESS –This parameter allows the site to control the CPRS 'tabs' write access. The control can be at the user, division, system (site), or package level. The tabs that can be defined are: C for Consults, D for Discharge Summary, M for Meds, O for orders, P for Problems, or S for Surgery.
- OR CPRS WRITE ACCESS ERROR: This error message tells the CPRS user why they are not allowed to perform an attempted action. For example: if write access is restricted and a user attempts to create an order.
- OR MHV URL: This parameter contains the website URL that VistA will access after the user clicks on the MHV Button in the CPRS GUI.
- OR SIMULATE ON EHR: This parameter can be used to simulate as if the site migrated to an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. This will only work in the test/pre-prod account. When set to YES, it will cause the ONEHR^ORACCESS API to return a "1", as if the site is on EHR. It should only be used for testing purposes.
- ORWCH PAUSE INPUT: The purpose of this parameter is to allow control whether or not the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) will pause the processing of user input while Windows messages are being processed. When this doesn’t occur, access violation errors may happen.

## Modified Parameters

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- ORWPCE ASK ENCOUNTER UPDATE: The description has been modified. No other changes were made to this parameter or how it affect CPRS.
- ORWPCE FORCE PCE ENTRY: The description has been modified. No other changes were made to this parameter or how it affect CPRS.
