New Security Keys

New security keys, SCENI IEMM EDIT, SCENI ENCOUNTER EDIT, and SCENI MEANS TEST EDIT lock the following protocols and options. Because of the nature of the data which can be edited through the Edit Outpatient Encounter option, it is highly recommended that the SCENI ENCOUNTER EDIT security key not be given to all users.

SCENI IEMM EDIT

> Patient Demographics \[SCENI PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS\]

> Retransmit Error \[SCENI REFLAG ERROR\]

> Check Out \[SCENI CHECKOUT INTERVIEW\]

> Load/Edit Patient Data \[SCENI CALL LOAD EDIT\]

SCENI ENCOUNTER EDIT

> Edit Outpatient Encounter \[SCENI OP ENCOUNER EDIT\]

> Encounter Information \[SCENI ENCOUNTER INFORMATION\]

SCENI MEANS TEST EDIT

> This key is used to limit the users who can complete a Means Test through Load/Edit when using the IEMM correction tool.

Event Handler Changes

The Ambulatory Care event handler, SCDX AMBCARE EVENT, currently exists as an item on the PIMS event driver, SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENTS. The post init routine will remove it from the item list and add it to the exit action of that same protocol. This is to ensure that the capturing and validation of workload data is the last event to be processed.

Data Dictionary Changes

- TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER ERROR file \[^SD(409.75)\]

Four new cross references have been added.

On the Transmitted Encounter field (#.01): AEDT AECL AER ACOD

On the Error Code field (#.02): AER2 ACOD2

- TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER ERROR CODE file \[^SD(409.76)\]

> Four new fields and one cross reference have been added.

> SOURCE OF ERROR (#.02)

> CORRECTIVE ACTION DESCRIPTION (#21)

> VALIDATION LOGIC (#31)

> CORRECTION LOGIC (#41)

The D cross reference has been added. It is a standard cross reference used to aid in the look up process.

The ERROR CODE DESCRIPTION field is also now an identifier for lookups on this file.

- HOSPITAL LOCATION file \[^SC(44)\]

A new field has been added - WORKLOAD VALIDATION AT CHK OUT (#30).

This field is used to determine if the validation software is to be executed at the completion of a successfully checked-out encounter.

Database Integration

Integration Agreement \#872 covers the request to manipulate the entries in the item list and exit action of the PROTOCOL file (#101).

Routine Mapping

Unless you are currently mapping the routines, there are no routines to map.

Routine Summary

The following is a list of the routine(s) included in this patch. The second line of each of these routine(s) will look like:

User Release Notes

Introduction

This patch installs the Incomplete Encounter Management Module (IEMM), part of the Ambulatory Care Reporting Project (ACRP) Phase II. The patch will provide the data validation tools necessary for sites to maintain the correctness of outpatient data being transmitted to the Austin Automation Center.

<u>Validator</u>

The validation logic is a new piece of functionality installed with this patch. The previous Ambulatory Care software only checked to ensure that a value was present in each data field sent to Austin. It did not check the validity of that data. This new software will perform the same validation checks as the Austin database to identify errors before they are transmitted. The validator (or edit checker) will review the entire encounter rather than stopping after the first error is found. All errors are stored for later reporting and correction.

This validation will continue to be performed during the nightly background job. It can also be performed when there is a complete check out for an appointment. This is provided if the parameter WORKLOAD VALIDATION AT CHK OUT for the respective clinic is set to YES, and an entry exists in the TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file. The validation software will also be executed as part of the Correct Incomplete Encounters menu option.

<u>Error Correction Tools</u>

Tools have been developed to help users correct the errors that are found in encounters. The Correct Incomplete Encounters option allows a user to select, display, and correct errors using a List Manager display format. After an attempt is made to correct the error, the validator will be run for that encounter to check for any additional errors. If an error is found it will be presented to the user. The correction actions of this option are locked with the SCENI IEMM EDIT security key except for the Encounter Information action which is locked with the SCENI ENCOUNTER EDIT security key.

The Edit Outpatient Encounter option allows a user with the SCENI ENCOUNTER EDIT security key to correct specific data for an encounter. Four data items for the encounter are available for correction: appointment type, division, clinic stop code, and eligibility.

New Menu Options

The Incomplete Encounter Management menu has been added to the Ambulatory Care Reporting menu. This new menu contains the Incomplete Encounter Reports submenu and the Correct Incomplete Encounters option.

> Incomplete Encounter Reports

> These reports will only display those errors remaining in the TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER ERROR file since the last running of the encounter validation software. This file is dynamic and is updated each time the validator runs.

> Alpha List of Incomplete Encounters - This report provides a list of all errors found in the TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER ERROR file (#409.75) at the time the report is generated.

> Incomplete Encounter Error Report - This report provides a detailed report of errors by patient with a wide range of selection criteria and encounter identifying information.

> Incomplete Encounters by Error Code - This report provides a list of the errors which are in the TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER ERROR CODE file (#409.76).

> Summary Report – IEMM - This report prints a summary showing total encounters for a date range and the number and percentage of incomplete encounters. The report may be printed as summary only or summary with detail.

> Correct Incomplete Encounters - This option allows a user to select, display, and correct errors using a List Manager display format.

The Edit Outpatient Encounter option has been added to the Supervisor Ambulatory Care menu. It allows you to change four fields which are set by the software and are normally uneditable.

New Bulletin

This patch installs a new bulletin, SCDX INCOMPLETE ENCOUNTER MGMT. This bulletin provides the same information as the Summary Report - IEMM option, but in a bulletin format. The bulletin is sent to a user-defined mail group.

The nightly bulletin from the processing of the encounters to Austin currently contains all of the encounters with errors. This has been changed so that the bulletin only contains a summary report. The individual errors can be viewed through the new report options.

Bulletin Example

> Subj: Transmission of data to NPCDB completed \[#4287\] 20 Jan 98 13:17 7

> Lines

> From: POSTMASTER (Sender: Smith,James) in 'IN' basket. Page 1 \*\*NEW\*\*

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Transmission of data to the National Patient Care Database has completed.

> A total of 55 Outpatient Encounters were sent.

> A total of 41 Outpatient Encounters were not sent.

> Please review the IEMM Error listing for further detail.

> Select MESSAGE Action: IGNORE (in IN basket)//

New Security Keys

New security keys, SCENI IEMM EDIT, SCENI ENCOUNTER EDIT, and SCENI MEANS TEST EDIT lock the following protocols and options.

SCENI IEMM EDIT

> Patient Demographics \[SCENI PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS\]

> Retransmit Error \[SCENI REFLAG ERROR\]

> Check Out \[SCENI CHECKOUT INTERVIEW\]

> Load/Edit Patient Data \[SCENI CALL LOAD EDIT\]

SCENI ENCOUNTER EDIT

> Edit Outpatient Encounter \[SCENI OP ENCOUNER EDIT\]

> Encounter Information \[SCENI ENCOUNTER INFORMATION\]

SCENI MEANS TEST EDIT

> This key is used to limit the users who can complete a Means Test through Load/Edit when using the IEMM correction tool.

Registration (DG) Changes

The Load/Edit Patient Data option \[DG LOAD PATIENT DATA\] has been changed. The system determines a patient’s need for Means Testing and Copay Testing and, if necessary, now allows you to complete the required test through this option. For the Copay Test, the veteran has to request the test be completed.

If the user is accessing Load/Edit through the IEMM correction tool, the SCENI MEANS TEST EDIT key will be used to restrict users from completing the Means Test.
