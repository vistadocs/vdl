The build for this patch is distributed as part of a multi-package build that contains PXRM\*2.0\*22 and OR\*3.0\*357. The multi-package build name is TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECKS 1.0.

## This patch releases two new National Reminder Order Checks for placing Teratogenic Medications. A pre-installation routine will identify any previously identified components and rename them correctly, and the patch installation will create or overwrite VA-named, national reminder components

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## This patch also addresses two bug fixes in the Reminder Order Check setup. To address these fixes, the Reminder Order Check System had to be divided into two files:

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- File 801 Reminder Order Check Items Group

> File 801 contains the grouping of Orderable Items. This file has also been modified to allow groups to include entries from the Drugs file, file \#50, VA Generic file, file \#50.6 and VA Drug Class file, file \# 50.605.

- File 801.1 Reminder Order Check Rules.

> File 801.1 contains the Reminder Order Check Rules.

These changes will allow sites to modify the Active and Testing Fields for National Rules.

This patch also fixes a Mumps error when the select order checks prompt times out.

To support the two-file structures, the existing menu options have been renamed and two new options will be released with this patch: Reminder Order Check Rule Inquiry and Reminder Order Check Test. The method for creating and editing Reminder Order Checks has been modified to use ScreenMan forms. See the Reminders Manager’s Manual for further instructions.

## ## ## Estimated Installation Time: 10-15 minutes

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## ## Pre-Installation Step:

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Please Note!

- All existing reminder order checks will need to be rebuilt after installation of PXRM\*2\*22. We recommend that you print a copy of any existing Reminder Orderable Item Groups (File \#801) on your system, using FileMan or Reminder Order Checks Inquiry. This will be used to help you re-create order checks after the install. See [Appendix B](#appendix-b-creating-a-list-of-orderable-item-groups-and-order-checks) for an example of using the Reminder Order Checks Inquiry to do this.

## # Installation 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This build can be installed with users on the system, but it should be done during non-peak hours.

*The installation needs to be done by a person with DUZ(0) set to "@."NOTE: DO NOT QUEUE THE INSTALLATION, because this installation asks questions requiring responses and queuing will stop the installation. A Reminders Manager or CAC should be present to respond to these.*

1.  Print a copy of any existing Reminder Orderable Item Groups on your system. This will be used to help you re-create order checks after the install, since all existing reminder order checks will need to be rebuilt after installation of PXRM\*2\*22. See [Appendix B](#appendix-b-creating-a-list-of-orderable-item-groups-and-order-checks) for an example.
2.  Retrieve host file containing the multi-package build

> Use ftp to access the build (the name of the host file is TERATOGENIC \_MEDICATIONS \_ORDER_CHECKS.KID.) from one of the following locations:

> Albany REDACTED

> Hines REDACTED

> Salt Lake City REDACTED REDACTED

> NOTE: Download it as an ASCII type file.

3.  Install the build first in a training or test account.

> Installing in a non-production environment will give you time to get familiar with new functionality and complete the setup for reminders and dialogs prior to installing the software in production.

4.  Load the distribution.

In programmer mode type, D ^XUP, select the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu (XPD MAIN), then the Installation option, and then the option LOAD a Distribution. Enter your directory name and TERATOGENIC \_MEDICATIONS_ORDER\_ CHECKS.KID.at the Host File prompt.

Example

> Select Installation Option: LOAD a Distribution

> Enter a Host File: TERATOGENIC \_MEDICATIONS \_ORDER_CHECKS.KID

> KIDS Distribution saved on NOV 17, 2011@11:53:53: OR\*3\*357 and PXRM\*2.0\*22

From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following options:

## Backup a Transport Global

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> This option will create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT back up any other changes such as DDs or templates.

2.  Compare Transport Global to Current System

> This option will allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).

3.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global

> This option will allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global. If there are any discrepancies, do not run the Install Package(s) option. Instead, run the Unload a Distribution option to remove the Transport Global from your system. Retrieve the file again from the anonymous directory (in case there was corruption in FTPing) and Load the Distribution again. If the problem still exists, log a Remedy ticket and/or call the national Help Desk (1-888-596-HELP) to report the problem.

4.  Print Transport Global (optional)

> This option will allow you to view the components of the KIDS build.

5.  Install the build.

> From the Installation menu on the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu, run the option Install Package(s). Select the build TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECKS 1.0 and proceed with the install. If you have problems with the installation, log a Remedy ticket and/or call the National Help Desk to report the problem.

> Select Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation

> Select Installation Option: INSTALL PACKAGE(S)

> Select INSTALL NAME: TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECKS 1.0

Answer "YES" to the following prompt:

> \*BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE 'REMINDER ORDERABLE ITEM GROUP' AS FILE \#801!

> Shall I write over your REMINDER ORDERABLE ITEM GROUP File? YES// yes

Answer "NO" to the following prompts:

> Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO// NO

> Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during install? NO// NO

> Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//

> NOTE:DO NOT QUEUE THE INSTALLATION, because this installation may ask questions requiring responses and queuing will stop the installation. The most common are replacements for finding items or quick orders during the installation of Reminder Exchange file entries.

> Installation Example

> See [Appendix A](\l).

6.  Install File Print (OPTIONAL)

> Use the KIDS Install File Print option to print out the results of the installation process. You can select the multi-package build or any of the individual builds included in the multi-package build.

> Select Utilities Option: Install File Print

> Select INSTALL NAME: TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER

7.  Build File Print (OPTIONAL)

> Use the KIDS Build File Print option to print out the build components.

> Select Utilities Option: Build File Print

> Select BUILD NAME: TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECKS 1.0

> DEVICE: HOME//

8.  Post-installation routine

> The installation will add/update the following items on your system.

> Data Dictionary:

> ================

> FILE \# NAME

> 801 REMINDER ORDER CHECK ITEMS GROUP

> 801.1 REMINDER ORDER CHECK RULES

> Input Templates:

> ================

> PXRM EDIT ORDER CHECK FILE \#801 DELETE AT SITE

> Options:

> ========

> PXRM MANAGERS MENU

> PXRM ORDER CHECK MENU

> PXRM ORDER CHECK RULE EDIT

> PXRM ORDER CHECK RULE INQ

> PXRM ORDER CHECK TESTER

> PXRM ORDER CHK ITEMS GROUP EDT

> PXRM ORDER CHK ITEMS GROUP INQ

> Print Templates:

> ================

> PXRM ORDER CHECK ITEMS GROUP FILE \#801 SEND TO SITE

> PXRM ORDER CHECK RULE INQUIRY FILE \#801.1 SEND TO SITE

> Form:

> PXRM OCR EDIT FILE \#801.1 SEND TO SITE

> PXRM OCR EDIT HISTORY FILE \#801.1 SEND TO SITE

> PXRM OCR EDIT RESTRICTED FILE \#801.1 SEND TO SITE

> The installation will add the following item to the Reminder Exchange File:

> 811.8 VA-TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECKS

> The post-install routine will install all the components of this Exchange file entry on your system. After the installation has finished, if you discover that any of these components weren’t installed correctly, you can use the Reminder Exchange option on the Reminders Manager Menu to install them.

> After the exchange install, the following items should be in the corresponding files:

> File 801

> VA-TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS (CAT D OR C) GROUP

> VA-TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS (CAT X) GROUP

> File 801.1

> VA-TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECK (CAT D) RULE

> VA-TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECK (CAT X) RULE

9.  Use the printout of existing Reminder Orderable Item Groups on your system to re-create order checks. See the Clinical Reminders Manager’s Manual for guidance on using the new Reminders order checking system.
10. Add ADAPALENE/BENZOYL PEROXIDE to VA-TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS (CAT D OR C) GROUP Pharmacy items. This is necessary because there is a duplicate in NDF file 50.6 for that name, and the patch install’s use of reminder exchange to create the entries cannot overcome that discrepancy. The decision was made to take it out of the patch and have folks add it manually. The product has extremely minimal use across the country anyway, so the risk if it’s missed is low.

# Appendix C: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about the Teratogenic Medications Order Check

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Q: What is a “teratogenic” medication?

A: A teratogenic medication is one that can increase the risk of birth defects if taken at a particular time during pregnancy. A known teratogen is a medication that causes birth defects in humans. Examples include thalidomide (limb defects), isotretinoin (syndrome of defects including oral clefts), valproic acid (neural tube defects), and mycophenolate (facial clefts, anotia). A potential teratogen is a medication that causes malformations or other abnormal pregnancy outcomes in animal studies – these outcomes are more concerning if they occur at doses similar to human doses. Some medications increase the risk for pregnancy loss (miscarriage), growth abnormalities (e.g., growth restriction), or functional deficits (e.g., decreased fetal kidney function). These are also important adverse reproductive effects.

Q: What is the new Teratogenic Medication Order Check?

A: In response to several requests, a CPRS Order Check was developed to remind providers when they prescribe a known or potential teratogen for a female patient of child-bearing potential. This reminder system is based on the FDA pregnancy categories (A, B, C, D, and X) and a set of additional criteria from First Data Bank that uses published literature and other available information. For lactating patients, the system also uses criteria to notify providers when a medication can cause serious side effects in a breastfeeding infant

Q: What are the FDA pregnancy categories?

A: The FDA categories are a helpful system for distinguishing the relative teratogenic risk of a medicine based on studies in animals and experience in human pregnancy. As a health care provider, your awareness of these issues can help you better prescribe for and counsel your female patients of child-bearing potential.

Q: How will the Teratogenic Medication Order Check work?

A: When a provider prescribes a medication with a pregnancy category D or X for a female patient between the ages of 18 and 50, the system will automatically provide an order check to ensure that you are aware of the reproductive risk associated with the medication. Certain additional medications with evidence of concern (e.g., some category C medications or FDA-unclassified medications) will also trigger an alert.

  
Q: What do you do if you get an Order Check?

A: (1) Consider whether this medication is most appropriate for the patient’s condition or whether there are other appropriate options with less reproductive risk.

> \(2\) Counsel the patient about the risks and benefits of treatment should pregnancy occur.

> \(3\) Ask the patient about pregnancy planning and use of contraception. This risk/benefit discussion is an important one.

> \(4\) For breastfeeding patients, consider whether there is an alternative medication with lower concentrations in breast milk or fewer risks for the infant and encourage the patient to discuss her medications with the infant’s pediatrician. LactMed (<http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/htmlgen?LACT>) is an online resource from the NIH that provides available information about use of medications during lactation.

Q: Where can I get information about the pros/cons of continuing use of a teratogenic medication during pregnancy?

A: Deciding whether to continue a potential or known teratogen during pregnancy is complicated. Not treating or under-treating a pregnant woman’s medical condition can be riskier to the fetus than the medication itself. It is helpful to read the pregnancy subsection of drug labeling, which provides information about the reproductive risks of medications. Current labeling can be found at Drugs@FDA or at [www.DailyMed.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.DailyMed.nlm.nih.gov). Reprotox is an online resource that summarizes available information about the reproductive risks of medications. Reprotox may be available online through your facility’s library and will be available through the VACO library in the near future. The Organization of Teratology Information Services has fact sheets available online about medications and their risks during pregnancy (<http://www.otispregnancy.org/otis-fact-sheets-s13037#1>).Your local pharmacist and women’s health providers can provide more information.

Q: How can I help my patients avoid unintended pregnancy?

A: About 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned. During patient encounters, ask women of child-bearing potential (age 15 to 50) about their plans for pregnancy and need for contraception.

The most effective reversible contraceptives are the IUDs (Mirena or Paragard) and subdermal implants (Nexplanon, previously Implanon). These contraceptives are available through the VA prosthetics department and can be inserted by a local trained women’s health provider. Oral contraceptive pills and emergency contraception are on the VA formulary, and condoms are available through the VA. Female Veterans using contraceptives other than IUDs and implants should be advised to keep a supply of emergency contraception on hand in case of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure.

Q: When will the Order Check be available?

A: The Order Check will come as a VistA Clinical Reminders patch, PXRM\*2\*22.  At the time of this message, release is anticipated during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2012.

Q: How often will this Order Check appear?

A: Clinicians will be notified every time any category D or X medications or certain other medications with evidence for concern (e.g., some category C medications or FDA-unclassified medications) are ordered for a female patient of child-bearing potential who is without documentation of medical inability to become pregnant.

Q: Will the Order Check display even if the patient has no chance of becoming pregnant, such as post-hysterectomy?

A: No. The Order Check is designed to recognize several exclusion criteria that can be generally described as “medical inability to conceive.”  For example, patients for whom the appropriate ICD-9<sup>a</sup> code for hysterectomy is recorded will not trigger an alert.  Other ICD-9<sup>a</sup> exclusion criteria include menopausal state and IUD use.

Q: Can clinicians add information to the electronic health record that should exclude a patient from this Order Check?

A: Yes, each site can define additional situations or “Health Factors” when the Order Check does not apply. The local application support team can add these Health Factors to the Reminder Term called “VA-TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECK EXCLUSIONS (TERM).” The support team can also suggest to the Women’s Health Program Office that a Health Factor be added as part of a subsequent national update.

The FDA published a proposed rule in the May 29, 2008, Federal Register that proposes new labeling regulations for prescription drugs. These regulations, once implemented, will eliminate the pregnancy categories from drug labeling. When a final rule publishes, VHA will determine how to best update this order check process so that it will remain both current and useful to VA providers.
