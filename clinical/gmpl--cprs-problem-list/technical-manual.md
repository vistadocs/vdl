# Introduction

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Problem List application is used to document and track a patient's problems. It provides the clinician with a current and historical view of the patient's health care problems across clinical specialties. It will allow each identified problem to be traced through the VistA health care system in terms of treatment, test results, and outcome.

The Problem List application is designed to be used by primary caregivers such as physicians, nurses, social workers, and others, in both inpatient and outpatient settings, as well as by ward clerks and coding clerks.

Various data entry methods are possible with this application.

## Functionality

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- Allows a clinician to view an individual problem list for any given patient.
- Supports a variety of specialized views of a patient's problem list.
- Uses the Lexicon Utility, which permits use of "natural" terminology when selecting a problem. Each term is well‑defined and understandable. A user, site, or application may substitute a preferred synonym.
- May be linked to other sections of the medical record, such as Health Summary and Integrated Billing Encounter Forms.
- If Problem List Health Summary components are used in conjunction with the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), then you may view Problem List from other treating facilities within the VA, provided Remote Data Views (RDV) have been implemented (includes Health Summary patched up to GMTS\*2.7\*29, and Order Entry/Results Reporting patched up to patch OR\*3.0\*85)
- Supports importation of problem information from other clinical settings outside the immediate VAMC.
- Allows reformulation of a problem.
- Supports multiple forms of data capture: Direct clinician entry, clerk entry, encounter forms, foreign problem lists, scannable encounter forms, hand‑held devices, etc.

## Changes Made by GMPL\*2\*49 – Problem Selection List Enhancements

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This patch introduces enhancements to the Problem Selection List feature that may be used as an alternative method to quickly document common and/or frequently used problems by selecting problems from the curated specialty categories containing the top SNOMED CT diagnoses pre-mapped to ICD-10-CM called the VA-National Problem Selection List. This patch includes updates to the Problem Selection List menu items and menu actions to assist in the creation and maintenance of selection lists related to editing and assigning of problem selection lists to users and locations.

![](problem-list-technical-manual-version-2-updated-with-gmpl-2-49/002.png)

A CAC, or appropriate person, can assign a Problem Selection List that will display on the left of the Problems tab. If a list is assigned, there will be a listing of categories and when the category is selected, the pane below displays the problems it contains. This screen capture shows the VA-National Problem Selection List Content.

To support these enhancements, the file structure for \#125 and \#125.11 were redesigned and the data is migrated with new reports to identify duplicate selection lists and categories and selection list names in mixed/lower case. Because mixed case list names are no longer allowed, this patch converts any lists with mixed case to all upper case. A new class field was added to both \#125 and \#125.11 files to identify, control, and manage the editing capabilities of national, VISN, or local level lists and categories. In CPRS, the VA-National Problem Selection List will display by default unless users have previously defined their own selection lists. The national selection list will be nationally distributed and maintained but require Clinical Application Coordinators (CAC) to import the updates using new GMPL Selection List Import feature.

This patch works with the OR\*3.0\*429 patch that migrates existing problem selection list assignments that currently exist into a new parameter setting. The patch migrates the list assignments that will be available after the patch is installed.

## Changes Made by GMPL\*2\*40 – Erroneous Problem File Cleanup

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To correct an issue where SNOMED codes get stored in the DIAGNOSIS field \#.01 instead of ICD codes, three new options have been added to the Problem List Mgt Menu \[GMPL MGT MENU\]:

1.  SNOMED in Diagnosis Field Error Report \[GMPL DIAG ERROR REPORT\]
2.  SNOMED in Diagnosis Field Cleanup Report \[GMPL DIAG CLEANUP REPORT\]
3.  Generate SNOMED in Diagnosis Field Err/Cleanup Rpt \[GMPL GENERATE DIAG RPTS\]

The first two reports identify fields that have the error and where they are cleaned up. The third option enables users with access to this menu to rerun the filescan and cleanup tasks for any potential new errors.

## Changes Made by GMPL\*2\*45 – Changes to Comment Length and a Provider Can Now View, Edit, or Delete Comments Entered by Another Provider

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The length of the comment field has been changed from less than 60 characters (which includes spaces and punctuation) to less than 200.

Also, providers can now view, edit, and delete another provider’s comments on a problem.

## Changes Made by GMPL\*2\*42 - PROBLEM LIST SUPPORT FOR ICD-10-CM

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This is the Problem List patch to support the requirements of ICD-10-CM implementation. The Problem Search function will continue to originate with the Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT and follow the algorithm introduced by the Problem List Data Standardization effort and CPRS v29. Prior to the ICD-10-CM implementation date (1 October 2015), the selected

SNOMED CT code will continue to be resolved to the corresponding ICD-9-CM code(s), and all of the Problem List display and print options will continue to render the diagnostic codes as ICD-9-CM.

Beginning on the ICD-10-CM implementation date, the selected SNOMED CT code will be resolved to the corresponding ICD-10-CM code(s), and all of the Problem List display and print options will render the diagnostic codes as either ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM, depending upon the date when the code for the problem was last edited.

### Diagnosis Code Search

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- The Problem List application continues to provide the ability to search for SNOMED CT diagnoses and will assign a generic ICD-10 diagnosis code of R69 upon selection from the Lexicon Utility. When the VA transitioned to ICD-10, the VA did not have a SNOMED CT to ICD-10 map available, therefore R69 (the equivalent to ICD-9-CM 799.9) had to be assigned to each SNOMED CT term upon each problem selection. The Problem List package requires an ICD code along with the SNOMED CT problem upon saving in the patient’s record.
- ICD diagnosis code search is prohibited on the Problems tab.

(\*\*<u>NOTE</u>: On the Problem List Lexicon Search dialog, the system will display the selected SNOMED CT description and the SNOMED CT concept code. To view the ICD code, click on the problem to open the Problem Details window.)

![](problem-list-technical-manual-version-2-updated-with-gmpl-2-49/003.png)

Users may use the following search methods:

- SNOMED CT concept codes
- Text strings (i.e. SNOMED CT descriptions)

### Add/Edit/Store Diagnosis Code

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- If the “Current System Date” is on or after the ICD-10 activation date, the Problem List package will provide the ability to perform the following actions for ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes (problems) through the Action List items on the patient’s problem list.
  - New Problem: Add an active SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of R69.
  - Change: Change an active SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of R69.
  - Inactivate: Inactivate a problem containing a SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of R69.
  - Verify: Verify an active SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of R69.
  - Annotate: Annotate and update an active SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of R69.
  - Remove: Remove an active SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of R69.
  - Restore: Restore an active SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of R69.
  - View Details: View details of an active SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of R69.

### Display Diagnosis

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- The Problem List allows for the display of problems for the Active View, Inactive View, and Removed View options within the initial Problem List.
  - The Problem List application will display the patient’s list of problems. Problems entered prior to July of 2013 will display in ICD-9-CM and those entered after will be represented in SNOMED CT. Problems added through Reminder Dialogs or Group notes will display problems in an ICD-10 diagnosis short description within the initial Problem List screen and will label whether an ICD diagnosis code is either ICD-9 or ICD-10.
- When user selects the ‘View Details’ action, the CPRS Problem List application will:
  - Display the details of an SNOMED CT diagnosis linked to an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code or the placeholder ICD-10-CM code of R69 with its full descriptions/definitions, or
  - If the problem was updated via the encounter form, it would display the newly linked ICD-10-CM code and not the R69.
  - Print the SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM diagnosis code audit history
- When using the ‘View Details’ action, the CPRS Problem List application will display the ICD-10 label, ICD-10-CM diagnosis code, and short description within the audit history.

![](problem-list-technical-manual-version-2-updated-with-gmpl-2-49/004.png)![](problem-list-technical-manual-version-2-updated-with-gmpl-2-49/005.png)

## Print Diagnosis

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- When the user selects the View Details action:
  - If the date the diagnosis code was entered is on or after the ICD-10 activation date, the Problem List application will provide the ability to print the problem represented in SNOMED CT and the a ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes and full descriptions/definitions.
  - The Problem List application will designate whether a diagnosis code is SNOMED CT, ICD-9 or ICD-10.

![](problem-list-technical-manual-version-2-updated-with-gmpl-2-49/006.png)

## Changes Made by GMPL\*2.0\*44 - PROBLEM LIST ICD-10 CHANGES FOR CLINICAL REMINDERS

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This build updates the Clinical Reminders Index cross-references in the Problem file (#9000011) to accommodate ICD-10 CM diagnosis codes. It restructures the Problem List portion of the Clinical Reminders Index to a generic format that can support ICD and SNOMED CT coding systems. This format is:

> ^PXRMINDX (9000011, CODING SYSTEM,”ISPP”, CODE, STATUS, PRIORITY, DFN, DLM, DAS)

> ^PXRMINDX (9000011, CODING SYSTEM,”PSPI”, DFN, STATUS, PRIORITY, CODE, DLM, DAS)

Where CODING SYSTEM is a three-character abbreviation as defined in the Coding Systems file (#757.03) and CODE is the code, not the pointer. For details, see the Clinical Reminders Index Technical Manual (PXRM_INDEX_TM).

The post-install routine will start a background job to rebuild the file \#9000011 index in the new format.

## Changes Made by GMPL\*2\*36 - EXTENSIONS TO ACCOMMODATE SNOMED-CT

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The purpose of this patch is to accommodate the use of the Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) for selection of Patient Problems, and to dovetail with the efforts of Standard Terminology Service (STS) to implement SNOMED CT on both the Enterprise Terminology Server and the Clinical Lexicon, using the New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) strategy for vetting and deployment of novel clinical expressions.

This patch introduces changes required by CPRS v29 for selection of Patient Problems using SNOMED CT.

A new bulletin, GMPL PROBLEM NTRT BULLETIN, is added by the patch. This bulletin is sent to members of the FORUM mail group g.PROBLEM LIST NTRT when a SNOMED CT Concept is selected by the user for which no ICD-9-CM codes are mapped. The mail group is populated with members of OI&T’s Standards and Terminology Service. When approved by the Domain Steward for Problem List, new standardized mappings will be deployed using the New Term Rapid Turnaround capability.

> **NOTE:** This bulletin has been disabled.

Two new options are included in the patch:

### Problem List NTRT Follow-up Report 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This report allows sites to evaluate problems with valid SNOMED CT Concept codes, which were unmapped to ICD at the time of entry.

The report may be filtered by Medical Center Division, Provider(s), and Time Interval.

### Problem List Freetext Follow-up Report

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This report allows sites to evaluate uncoded free text problems that have been entered by one or more providers over a specified time interval.

# Implementation and Maintenance

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Implementation and maintenance of Problem List occur several ways:

> 1\. By integration with other applications:

- Lexicon Utility (which uses the Multi‑term Lookup utility - MTLU - part of the Kernel Toolkit 7.3). The Lexicon Utility can be modified to meet local site needs, to make Problem List fit your hospital's preferences.
- Encounter Form (part of Integrated Billing)
- Health Summary
- Patient Care Encounter (PCE)
- CPRS

> Management of Problem List includes coordinating with these other entities. This linkage should remain transparent to users, but will require setup and coordination by the IRM office and Clinical Coordinators. See the technical and user manuals of those packages for implementation instructions.

> 2\. By setting site parameters with the GMPL PARAMETER EDIT option.

> 3\. By allocating menus and options (see page 7).

> By user customization either through GMPL USER PREFS MENU or GMPL BUILD LIST MENU (see the Problem List User Manual for descriptions of these).

## Edit PL Site Parameters \[GMPL PARAMETER EDIT\]

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This option lets you toggle four site parameters for the Problem List; these parameters are stored in the Problem List Site Parameters file \#125.99.

To modify these parameters, use the menu option GMPL MGT MENU - Edit PL Site Parameters. Changes made to these settings will affect ALL users. The settings included are as follows:

- VERIFY TRANSCRIBED PROBLEMS. Does your site require verification of problems entered by holders of the OREMAS key?
- PROMPT FOR CHART COPY. This setting is not used by the GUI version.
- USE CLINICAL LEXICON. Does your site use the Clinical Lexicon for problem lookup and entry, or should only free-text entries be used?
- DISPLAY ORDER. C: Chronological; R: Reverse chronological
- SCREEN DUPLICATE ENTRIES. Not used by the GUI Problems tab. If a duplicate entry is found when a new problem is being entered, the user is warned, and given the choice of whether or not to continue.
1.  A flag can be placed on problems that are entered by clerks so that a clinician must review the problems and verify them.
2.  You can choose whether the users will be prompted to have a chart copy printed when they exit the patient's problem list (if it has changed).
3.  You can choose whether to display the patient problem list in chronological or reverse chronological order.
4.  At the “Screen duplicate entries”: prompt, type Y and press \<Enter\>.

Select Problem List Mgt Menu Option: <u>Edit</u> PL Site Parameters

VERIFY TRANSCRIBED PROBLEMS: YES// <u>?</u>

Enter YES to flag transcribed entries for clinician verification.

CHOOSE FROM:

1 YES

0 NO

VERIFY TRANSCRIBED PROBLEMS: YES// <u>NO</u>

PROMPT FOR CHART COPY: YES, ASK// <u>?</u>

Enter YES to be prompted to print a new copy before exiting the patient's

list, if it has been updated.

CHOOSE FROM:

1 YES, ASK

0 NO, DON'T ASK

PROMPT FOR CHART COPY: YES, ASK// \<RET\>

DISPLAY ORDER: CHRONOLOGICAL// <u>?</u>

Enter the order in which the problems should be displayed for your site,

according to the date each problem was recorded.

CHOOSE FROM:

C CHRONOLOGICAL

R REVERSE‑CHRONOLOGICAL

DISPLAY ORDER: CHRONOLOGICAL// \<RET\>

Select Problem List Mgt Menu Option: \<RET\>

## Problem List Setup for CPRS

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Patch GMPL\*2\*10 created APIs to provide data to CPRS. See the sections on APIs and Remote Procedure Calls under External Relations in this manual. No other setup is required.

## Allocation of Security Keys

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- <span id="GMPL_IMPRT_UTIL_key" class="anchor"></span>GMPL IMPRT UTIL: The GMPL IMPRT UTIL key is used to access the new Import Utility menu option. Users with this access will be responsible for performing the National Problem Selection List updates and for creating/maintaining VISN or Local Problem Selection lists/categories if requested.
- GMPL ICD CODE: The GMPL ICD CODE security key is used to determine if the current user is trained and authorized to code provider text relating to the ICD Diagnosis codes. Recommended allocation: PIMS Coding Clerks.

## Importing Problem Selection List Content

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

With patch GMPL\*2.0\*49, authorized users can now import Problem Selection List content by using the Import Problem Selection List menu option. To provide their users with this content, sites can use the National Problem Selection List content available from a web site ([Problem List Content](http://vista.med.va.gov/cprs/html/PL_select_list_updates.html)) or sites can define Local or VISN lists with problem selection list content. One advantage of National Problem Selection List content is that it has SNOMED CT codes that are linked to ICD-10-CM codes for the same problem.

Sites can also create local or VISN content that can be imported if it is in the correct format. In addition, Local or VISN lists can be built in the Problem List’s List Manager interface using the Lexicon search to add each problem individually. Problems added to lists in this way will have a SNOMED CT code assigned to an ICD-10-CM code of R69.

The lists can then be edited, removing or adding categories and problems. When lists are completed, CACs can assign the lists at the User, Location, Division, or System level.

Importing lists provides several benefits:

- The ability to add SNOMED CT to ICD10 mappings into the Problem List (for example, GERD – Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease -\> K21.9)
- The ability to use SNOMED CT alternate descriptions
  - HTN – Hypertension instead of Hypertensive Disorder
  - Rash instead of Eruption
- Provides a quicker national content distribution mechanism compared to the patch method

### Importing Content Requires a Key

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Access to this option is controlled by the GMPL IMPRT UTIL key. Only users holding this key may access the Import Utility option.

### Required File Format for the GMPL Import Utility

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To import a problem selection list content file, the content must be in a very specific format. An example of the format for the National file is shown below. Instructions for creating a local or VISN file are given in the Creating Local Problem List Content for Import section.

The format of the national, VISN, or local files is very similar. The differences are the value in the class of Selection List and value in the Class of Category. National content will be maintained by a national group. Local personnel who create local or VISN lists must maintain their lists when there are changes released by the Standard Development Organizations for SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM.

### Format for Adding or Deleting Problem Selection List Content

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Below, CACs can see that they will have the ability to add or delete content using the Import Utility. For CACs, this applies only to Local or VISN lists. To add a selection list, category, or problem using the import utility, the user places a pound sign (#) in the first column of the spreadsheet. To delete, the user instead places an @ symbol in the first column. The correct format is shown below.

> **NOTE:** CACs can also use the menu options to delete items from local or VISN lists, but not from national lists.

> **WARNING:** If a user deletes an entire list, all categories in that list will also be deleted. The same applies to a category. If the user deletes a category, all problems under the chosen category will also be deleted.

### Creating Local/VISN Problem Selection List Content for Import

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1.  Obtain the Local/VISN Problem Selection List name, problem category name (s), and list of common problems for that category from the requester
2.  Use Microsoft Excel to build the Local/VISN Problem Selection List spreadsheet by entering the information based on the steps below
1.  Enter \# to add or @ to delete in (A1)
2.  Enter the name of the Selection List in (B1)
3.  Enter the Class (Local/VISN) of the Selection List (C1)
4.  Enter the Class (Local/VISN) of the Problem Category (D1)
5.  Enter \# to add or @ to delete (A2) Problem Category
6.  Enter the sequence number of the Problem Category (B2)
7.  Enter the Name of the Problem Category (C2)
8.  Enter the name of the Problem Category’s CPRS Display Name (D2)
9.  Enter the sequence number of the Problem Sequence (B3-n)
10. Enter the text of the Problem (SCT CONCEPT CODE) (B3-n)
11. Enter the linked ICD-10 code to the SNOMED term (C3-n)
12. Enter the SNOMED CT Concept ID with the letter ‘C’ prefixing the concept ID (D3-n)
13. Enter the SNOMED CT Description ID with the letter ‘D’ prefixing the description ID associated with the Problem Selection List text in step j (E3-n)
3.  How to find the SNOMED CT concept ID, description ID, and the Problem text in SNOMED CT:

Recommend using NLM SNOMED CT Browser. VA has an enterprise license, but each user must apply for the NLM UMLS license and set up a UMLS account before it will allow users to use the SNOMED CT browser.

[https://uts.nlm.nih.gov//license.html](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html) Then access the UMLS Terminology Services SNOMED CT Browser <https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/snomedctBrowser.html>

Click SNOMED CT in the banner and select SNOMED CT Browser from the drop down list

1.  Access the NLM SNOMED CT Browser and enter the problem in the search box to get a list of returned matches. Select the best matched term to represent the Problem. Only ACTIVE concepts from the Clinical Finding, Events, or Situation with Explicit Context hierarchies are appropriate for documentation in the Problem List package. This terms will be shown with the tags of (Finding), (Disorder), (Events), or (Situation) at the end of the description.

> ![](problem-list-technical-manual-version-2-updated-with-gmpl-2-49/009.png)

2.  From the list of returned matches, click on the term that best represents the problem requested. The system displays the concept in the top panel showing the Concept ID. Copy and paste the Concept ID.
14. Next look at the list of descriptions and choose the description that best matches the problem requested. Do Not select the Fully Specified Name as your description or the British spelling description; select one of the synonyms. Copy the description into the Selection List text cell or Column (B3-n) and the associated description ID for that SNOMED CT description and paste it into Column E.
15. Repeat for each problem entry.
4.  Prepare the spreadsheet for saving.
1.  Run spellcheck and make corrections as needed.
16. Ensure wrap text is not enabled on the Microsoft ribbon, if so uncheck and verify each row the wrap text is NOT enabled.
17. Review column A, the Problem Sequence, is listed sequentially.
18. Review column B, the Category Sequence, is listed sequentially.
19. Review column B, the Problem text and that it is in the required format CAD - Coronary Artery Disease (SCT 53741008).
20. Review column C, the ICD code, verify each 3 digit code has a decimal point and is using the forward slash when there are more than one ICD codes.
21. Review column D and verify the letter ‘C’ precedes the SNOMED CT concept ID.
22. Review column E and verify the letter ‘D’ precedes the SNOMED CT designation ID.
5.  Save the spreadsheet In Microsoft Excel AND in CSV formats
- Save the spreadsheet as Microsoft Excel XLSX for a readable copy
- IMPORTANT: Save the spreadsheet as a Comma Delimited (CSV) to use with the Import Utility but follow the steps below to do so.
1.  From the Tool Bar select File \| Save As.
2.  Change the file type from xlsx to csv by selecting the Comma Delimited option from the drop down.
3.  Select Save.
4.  The system displays a message, “the selected file type does not support workbooks that contain multiple sheets”, select OK.
5.  The system displays another message; \<File Name\> may contain features that are not compatible with CSV. Do you want to keep the workbook in this format? Select Yes.
6.  Close the spreadsheet with using the File \| Close menu item or clicking on the red x in the upper right corner. The system displays another message; “do you want to save the changes you made to \<File Name\>?” Select Don’t Save.
7.  Perform a check to verify the CSV file does not contain any errors due to saving; Open the CSV file by right clicking and open with Notepad from the menu.
1.  Review the row that contains the Problem category and verify at the end of the line it does not contain two commas.

    (i.e. *\#,T4 No Category Sequence,Local,Local,,).* If necessary remove one comma so that only one remains.
2.  Only the first line and each category should contain a comma at the end of the line.
3.  Select Edit \| Find to search the Selection text field for double quotes and remove any that are found.
4.  Scan to see if there any additional spaces in the Selection text field. Remove any preceding, trailing, or extra spaces between text. There should only be one space between the selection text and the SCT label (i.e.: Asthma (SCT 195967001)).
5.  Resave the CSV file (repeat steps 3-7 above until a clean file is created).

# Problem List Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following is a short list of files that problem lists uses and a brief description of what the file contains or changes that have been implemented with the release of patches GMPL\*2.0\*49 and OR\*3.0\*429.

- PROBLEM SELECTION LIST (#125) - The selection list name, associated class, and associated categories/headers/sequences. The CLINIC field is still there but it is no longer utilized.
- PROBLEM SELECTION LIST CONTENTS (#125.1) – This has now been moved to be a subfile of 125 and is no longer used.
- PROBLEM SELECTION CATEGORY (#125.11) - category names.
- PROBLEM SELECTION CATEGORY CONTENTS (#125.12) - With GMPL\*49, this becomes a subfile of file \#125.11 and will no longer be utilized.
- NEW PERSON (#200), “125.1” field PROBLEM SELECTION LIST - With GMPL\*49, this also will no longer be utilized. The User setting/entity of ORQQPL SELECTION LIST parameter takes its place.

> GMPL SELECTION LIST IMPORT Import Problem Selection List

> LOCK: GMPL IMPRT UTIL PACKAGE: PROBLEM LIST

> This patch also introduces a new import utility that will assist in the addition and distribution of National problem selection list content. This utility or menu option is locked with the new GMPL IMPRT UTIL security key and should only be assigned to CAC users. The utility allows CACs to import external list content to the VistA system using two import methods:

> HF CSV host file

> WEB CSV file from a web site

> Both methods require the selection list content to be in a specific spreadsheet format and saved as a comma separated value (.CSV) file. If utilizing the "HF" method, the CSV host file must reside on an accessible host system. If utilizing the "WEB" method, the CSV host file must reside on an accessible website.

> This patch will also install the first version of the VA-NATIONAL PROBLEM SELECTION LIST which comprises of the following national selection list categories:

> VA-PRIMARY CARE

> VA-CARDIOLOGY

> VA-DENTAL

> VA-DERMATOLOGY

> VA-DIABETES

> VA-EARS NOSE THROAT

> VA-EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

> VA-ENDO METAB EXCEPT DIABETES

> VA-GASTROENTEROLOGY

> VA-GENERAL SURGERY

> VA-GYNECOLOGY

> VA-HEMATOLOGY

> VA-INFECTIOUS DISEASE

> VA-MENTAL HEALTH

> VA-NEUROLOGY

> VA-NEUROSURGERY

> VA-ONCOLOGY

> VA-OPHTHALMOLOGY

> VA-ORTHOPEDICS

> VA-PAIN

> VA-PLASTIC SURGERY

> VA-POLYTRAUMA

> VA-PULMONARY

> VA-RENAL NEPHROLOGY

> VA-RHEUMATOLOGY

> VA-UROLOGY

> Once installed, commonly used diagnoses under these categories will be available for CAC's to copy and utilize when building local problem selection lists for their site users/clinics.

# How to Generate On-Line Documentation

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Routines

To get a list or printout of any or all of the Problem List routines, use the Kernel option XUPRROU (List Routines). This option is on the XUPR-ROUTINE-TOOLS menu on the XUPROG (Programmer Options) menu, which is a sub-menu of the EVE (Systems Manager Menu) option.

To get a list of all Problem List routines, type GMPL\* after you are prompted for routines.

The first line of each routine contains a brief description of the general function of the routine. Use the Kernel option XU FIRST LINE PRINT (First Line Routine Print) to get a list of just the first line of each Problem List routine.

Globals

> The globals exported by Problem List are ^GMPL( and ^AUPNPROB(. To get a printout of these global, use the Kernel option XUPRGL (List Global) on the XUPROG (Programmer Options) menu, which is a sub-menu of the EVE (Systems Manager Menu) option.

Files/Data Dictionary

> The number-spaces for Problem List files are 125 to 125.99. Use the VA Fileman option DILIST (List File Attributes) to get a list of these files. Depending on the Fileman template used to print the list, this option will print out all or part of the data dictionary for the Problem List files.

Menus/Options

> The menus and options exported by the Problem List package all begin with the GMPL name space. You can view individual options by using the Kernel option XUINQUIRE (Inquire). This option is on the menu XUMAINT (Menu Management), which is a sub-menu of the EVE (Systems Manager Menu) option.

> You can produce a diagram of the structure of the Problem List menus and their options with the Kernel option XQDIAGMENU (Diagram Menus). Choosing XQDIAGMENU allows you to further select XUUSERACC for a diagram of the menus, XUUSERACC1 for a detailed diagram of the menus with entry and exit actions, or XUUSERACC2 for an abbreviated diagram of the menu and options.

XINDEX

> XINDEX is a routine that produces a report called the VA Cross-Referencer, a technical and cross-reference listing of one routine or a group of routines. XINDEX provides a summary of errors and warnings for routines that do not comply with VA programming standards and conventions, a list of local and global variables and what sub-routine they are referenced in, and a listing of internal and external references (both routine calls and global references).

> When prompted to select routines, select GMPL\* for Problem List application routines. You can de-select the Problem initialization routines by selecting -GMPLI\* and -GMPLO\*.
