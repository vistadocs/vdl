The Laboratory System has interaction with almost all other Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) packages. Because of this interaction, as well as the patient data maintained in the Laboratory files, security is a real and necessary concern.
Laboratory System security is maintained by use of Laboratory security keys, Laboratory file security, and proper menu assignments. This guide will discuss each element of security management and give guidelines for the assignment of access to the Laboratory System.

# Laboratory Security Keys

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Each user of the Lab system must have the appropriate “keys” assigned to him before he can access the system. File \#19.1 (SECURITY KEY) contains the key names, a short description, and a list of the holders. You will need to enter the users’ names under each of the appropriate key names. Following is a list of the Lab keys:

> **NOTE:** It should be noted that these keys are used as locks for particular options, and are also checked elsewhere. Some routines check for user security keys.

Key Users

LRANAT Anatomic Pathology users\*

LRAPSUPER Anyone allowed to use the Anatomic Pathology Supervisor Menu and edit SNOMED codes

LRAU Autopsy Module users\*

LRBLOODBANK Blood Bank users

LRBLSUPER For Blood Bank supervisory level decisions

LRCY Cytology Module users\*

LREM Electron Microscopy Module users\*

LRLAB Laboratory Personnel only

LRLIASON Laboratory Application Coordinator

LRMICRO Microbiology users

LRMIVERIFY Microbiology personnel\*Key Users

LRSP Surgical Pathology Module users\*

LRSUPER Laboratory Supervisors

LRVERIFY Anyone who is authorized to verify lab results

LRPHMAN Phlebotomists\*

LRPHSUPER Supervisor of the phlebotomy collection team

Any combination of the security levels may be used, as deemed appropriate by the Laboratory.

\* This key may be used to lock menu options, as the site deems appropriate.

## # Accession/Load/Worklist Security

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Two additional fields have been added to the software package to allow other ancillary laboratories (not within Laboratory Service) to use this module for accessioning, verification, and reporting of their data:

1\. File \#68 (Accession Area), field: User Access Authorization  
This field points to File \#19.1, Security Keys. If there is an entry in this field, only users having the security key for this accession area will be able to use the verification options for data entry or modification of data. This will not affect users’ ability to accession tests for the Accession Area.

> **NOTE:** You will need to contact your site manager if new keys need to be established. The key must exist before it can be assigned. If users NOT having the Access Authorization selects the locked Accession Area, the system echoes “??” and allows them to select again.

2\. File \#68.2 (Load/Worklist), field: User Access Authorization  
A site may also select to prevent the building and unloading of load/work lists from users outside of the Accession Area. An entry in this field will give this additional security. This field also points to the File \#19.1.

If these fields have null entries, any user may access the Accession Area and the Load/Worklists.

## # Individual Module Requirements/Concerns

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### ### ## Blood Bank

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In addition to the LRLAB and LRVERIFY security keys, the Blood Bank Module requires only the LRBLOODBANK key to access the majority of the options. The LRBLSUPER key is, however, necessary to access all of the options in the Supervisor’s Menu, as well as to release incompatible blood using the Disposition-Relocation \[LRBLIDR\] option in the Inventory Menu.

Since the various options, excluding those in the Supervisor’s menu, do not require specific security keys, regulating access to the options must be accomplished via strict menu management. Menus must be constructed at each site, tailored to the actual needs of the individuals using the module.

## Anatomic Pathology

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In addition to the LRLAB and LRVERIFY security keys, the Anatomic Pathology Module requires several specific keys to access the appropriate Accession Area

LRANAT Anatomic Pathology users

LRAU Autopsy Module users

LRCY Cytology Module users

LREM Electron Microscopy Module users

LRSP Surgical Pathology Module users

and the options that should be limited to Supervisory grade or higher level personnel.

LRAPSUPER Anyone allowed to use the Anatomic Pathology Supervisor Menu and edit SNOMED codes

LRSUPER Laboratory Supervisors

Since the various options, excluding those in the Supervisor’s menu, do not require specific security keys once you have the appropriate Accession Area keys, regulating access to the options must be accomplished via strict menu management.

## Microbiology

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In addition to the LRLAB and LRVERIFY security keys, the Microbiology Module requires only the LRMICRO key to access the majority of the options and the LRMIVERIFY key to release results. The LRSUPER key is necessary to access the options in the Microbiology Supervisor’s Menu.

## Chemistry/Immunology

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Chemistry subscript Module requires the LRLAB and LRVERIFY security keys to access the majority of the options. The LRSUPER key is necessary to access the options in the Supervisor’s Menu.

## Phlebotomy

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The phlebotomy section requires the LRLAB and LRPHMAN keys to access the necessary options. The LRPHSUPER key is, however, necessary to access the options needed by the Phlebotomy supervisor.
