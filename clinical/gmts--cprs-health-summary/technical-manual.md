## # Introduction to Health Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Definition of a Health Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> A health summary is a user-customized, clinical summary report consisting of patient information *components*. Each component presents the most currently available summary data from one of the ancillary packages listed below, for a given patient, with optional limits by time, number of occurrences, and selection items. These summaries can be viewed online or printed.

## Packages Providing Data

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Automated Med Info OE/RR (Order Entry/Results Reporting

> Exchange (AMIE) Outpatient Pharmacy

> Allergy Tracking System Patient Care Encounter (PCE)

> Clinical Reminders Problem List

> Consults Progress Notes

> Dietetics Radiology

> Discharge Summary Registration

> Inpatient Medications Scheduling

> Lab Surgery

> Medicine VISTA Imaging

> Mental Health

> Nursing (Vital Signs)

## Components and Types

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Components and their behavior are specified by records in the Health Summary Component file (142.1). When a “permanent” Health Summary is created, its *type*, as defined by the owner/creator, is saved in the Health Summary Type file (142).

> *Definitions*

> *Component* Summarized patient data extracted from various DHCP software packages.

> *Type* A structure or template containing defined components and unique characteristics.

## Printing Health Summaries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Permanent or pre-defined health summaries may be run or printed for a single patient or all patients at a given hospital location (Patient Health Summary and Hospital Location Health Summary options). If a *clinic or operating room location* is selected (instead of a ward) in the Hospital Location Health Summary option, the user will be prompted to enter a beginning and ending visit or surgery date. Only those patients with visits or surgeries scheduled for the specified date will have health summaries generated.

## PDX Transmission of Health Summaries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Health Summaries (except components with selection items or unique local components) can be transmitted by PDX–Patient Data Exchange–which transfers patient data between VA facilities using the MailMan electronic mail utility. See PDX V. 1.5 documentation for more information.

## ## Set Up Site Parameters

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Use the Edit Health Summary Site Parameters option in the Health Summary Maintenance Menu \[GMTS IRM/ADPAC MAINT MENU\] to review and set up the site parameters. These parameters allow users to:

- Print an Outpatient Pharmacy Action Profile in tandem with a Health Summary.
- Print bar codes when Action Profiles are printed.
- Present Lab comments at display indicating comments are available for the Lab Chemistry and Hematology, the Lab Cumulative Selected, and the Lab Tests Selected components, or present the !! symbol to indicate comments are available for the Chemistry and Hematology and Lab Tests Selected components.
- Specify a spool device where PDX requests will be stored.
- Change the number of times each location prints on the cover sheet from 6 times to 1 time.

> See example on next page.

> *  
> Example*

> Select Health Summary Maintenance Menu Option: 7 Edit Health Summary Site Parameters

## Ad Hoc Health Summaries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Temporary (Ad hoc) health summaries can be created “on-the-fly” and run for individual patients, as follows.

1.  First, select a combination of components from a menu of all available components.
2.  Next, (if applicable) specify time limits, occurrence limits, hospital location, ICD text display, provider narrative display, and selection items for any of the components, or accept site-defined defaults.
3.  Then, select a patient and run the resulting health summary.

> Both pre-defined and Ad hoc health summaries may be run interactively on your terminal or directed to any printer. Pre-defined health summary types can also be queued to run nightly for all patients at any specified location(s). Either interactive or batch-mode print-by-location health summaries may also be printed “in tandem” with the Outpatient Pharmacy Action Profile (including bar codes) for each of the patients at the selected location.

## CPRS Interface

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Health Summary V. 2.7 interfaces with the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to provide Order Entry users with an integrated view of both *orders* (from CPRS) and *results* (from Health Summary). This interface, in turn, enhances Health Summary by allowing Health Summary users:

> • *Multiple Patient Selection*.

> You can select multiple patients from ward, clinic, treating specialty, attending physicians, personal or team lists. Health Summary uses enhanced patient look-up routines in CPRS for reporting results.

## Relationship to Integrated Billing’s Encounter Form Utilities

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> The Integrated Billing package (Encounter Form Utilities) includes a Print Manager that allows sites to define reports that should print along with encounter forms for a specific clinic or division and for specified appointments. One of the options, “Define Available Health Summary”, allows a health summary to be made available for use by the print manager. See the *IB Encounter Form Utilities User Manual* for further information.

## Nightly Batch Processing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> The Health Summary package allows coordinators to schedule batch processing of health summaries for patients in a particular ward, or to schedule batch processing of health summaries a specified number of days before patients are scheduled for clinic visits or operating rooms. The benefits of batch processing are.

> 1\) It enables the clinic to have the most currently available clinical information when the patient arrives for the appointment, and

> 2\) Processing of the prints takes place during non-peak computer hours.

> To use this, feature the IRM Service must first use the option Schedule/Unschedule Options on the TaskMan menu, and schedule the GMTS TASK STARTUP option to initiate nightly batch printing. (See page 31 in the *Health Summary Installation Guide.*) Each time this option runs, it uses the parameters set up by the Health Summary Coordinator in the Set-up Batch Print Locations option. For Version 2.7 of Health Summary, this option has been updated to recognize non-workdays. For clinics and operating rooms, if it is set up to print two days in advance, Tuesday’s clinics will print on Friday rather than on Sunday. If Tuesday happens to be a holiday, the Wednesday clinics will print on Friday.

## Health Summary Components Headers and Abbreviations

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Use the Information Menu option (available in all three Health Summary user menus) to get an online listing of the information contained in each health summary component or health summary type.

## Customized Health Summary Types

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> A user with access to the Coordinator’s or Enhanced menu can create a customized health summary type. Use the Create/Modify Health Summary Type menu option located on the Health Summary Enhanced Menu or the Build Health Summary Type submenu of the Health Summary Coordinator’s menu. Select the desired components, and (depending on the data required by the selected components) apply time limits or maximum occurrence limits to components which are date-sensitive. You may also apply ICD text, provider narrative, selection items, and header names for components that allow these to be specified.

> Users who do not have access to the enhanced or coordinator's menus can request a customized health summary type from their IRMS or Health Summary coordinator. The form entitled “Request for Health Summary Type”, located in Appendix A of the *Health Summary User Manual,* is a convenient way to submit such requests.

## Customizing the Ad Hoc Health Summary Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> You can also customize the Ad Hoc Health Summary Type with the Edit Ad Hoc Health Summary Type option on the Maintenance Menu. This option lets you modify time and/or occurrence limits, hospital location displayed, ICD text displayed, provider narrative displayed, header names, or assign selection items (tests like WBC, Glucose) to the *selected* health summary components (Lab Cumulative Selected, Lab Cumulative Selected 1-4, Lab Tests Selected, Measurement Selected, Vital Signs Selected, and Radiology Impression Selected, etc.). Consult with your clinical coordinator and/or users about which selection items they would like to have on their Health Summaries.

> You may select individual components and edit their default parameters or use the ^LOOP feature at the Select COMPONENT: prompt to loop through all of the components, editing the default values as you go.

> NOTE: When selecting components from the Ad Hoc Health Summary menu, entering “ALL” allows all components to be selected. If the first three characters of a Header Name for a component are designated as “All”, however, then only the defined component will be selected. Avoid conflicts and loss of functionality by not using “all” at the front of new header names.

# Files and Globals List

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following is a list of the files contained in the Health Summary package, including file number, name, global location, and an indicator if data comes with the file.

<u>Number</u> <u>Name</u> <u>Global</u> <u>Data</u>142 HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE ^GMT(142, YES

<u>Description</u>

This file contains the structure of a health summary. Components from the Health

Summary Components file (142.1) may be selected and restricted by number of

occurrences or time limits. The original creator of a type of Health Summary is the

owner of that type. Health summaries that are “owned” may not be modified or

deleted by anyone except the Clinical Coordinator. “Owned” Health Summaries may

be used by other users to print patient information.

142.1 HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT ^GMT(142.1, YES

<u>Description</u>

This file contains all components which may be used to create a Health Summary.

These entries are typically defined by a programmer. Components which represent

packages that are not in use may be disabled, so they will not be selected by users to

build new types of health summary reports.

142.5 HEALTH SUMMARY OBJECTS ^GMT(142.5, NO

<u>Description</u>

This file contains Health Summary Types that are to be embedded into another document as an object. The bulk of this file is made up of display flags which control how the object is to be embedded into the other document.

142.98 HEALTH SUMMARY USER PREFERENCES ^GMT(142.98, YES

<u>Description</u>

> This file determines how the list of Health Summary Types for the CPRS GUI report tab is to be organized (APPEND or OVERWRITE) for user selection. There are three major classes of Health Summary types, National (remote data view), user defined and system defined. User and system Health Summary Types are defined in the Kernel Parameters file. Append creates a single list, removing duplicates, and keeps the National Health Summary types group together. Overwrite stops building the list once a single group of Health Summary Types (User or System) is added to the list.

142.99 HEALTH SUMMARY PARAMETERS ^GMT(142.99, NO

<u>Description</u>

This file contains any site parameters that apply to the Health Summary package.

Currently there are six site parameters: 1) PROMPT FOR ACTION PROFILE; 2) INCLUDE BAR CODE ON ACTION PROFILES; 3) INCLUDE COMMENTS ON LABS; 4) SPOOL DEVICE 5) ERROR MESSAGE RECIPIENT; 6) SHORT HS BY LOCATION COVER

# Exported Menus, Options, and Function

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> The Health Summary Overall Menu \[GMTS MANAGER\] contains four menus.

> 1\. Health Summary Menu \[GMTS USER\]

> 2\. Health Summary Enhanced Menu \[GMTS ENHANCED USER\]

> 3\. Health Summary Coordinator’s Menu \[GMTS COORDINATOR\]

> 4\. Health Summary Maintenance Menu \[GMTS IRM/ADPAC MAINT MENU\]

> Assign these menus as follows.

> 1\. Give the Health Summary Menu \[GMTS USER\] menu to users who only need to print or display health summaries.

> 2\. Give the Health Summary Enhanced Menu \[GMTS ENHANCED USER\] menu to users who need to create, modify, or delete their *own* health summary types, in addition to printing health summaries.

> 3\. Give the Health Summary Coordinator’s Menu \[GMTS COORDINATOR\] menu to users who need to print or display health summaries, and who will also need to create, modify, or delete health summary types, and set up nightly batch printing at specified locations.

> 4\. Give the Health Summary Maintenance Menu \[GMTS IRM/ADPAC MAINT MENU\] to IRM staff or the Clinical Coordinator for any implementation and maintenance issues in Health Summary. This menu contains options to disable/enable health summary components for selection/display, create/modify new health summary components, edit and rebuild the Ad Hoc Health Summary Type, resequence the components in a health summary type, create/modify a health summary type, delete a health summary type, and edit health summary site parameters. <span id="GMTS_2_7_94_PS_MED_RECON_CONFIG_CHK" class="anchor"></span>With the release of GMTS\*2.7\*94 patch, it also contains a new GMTS PS MED RECON CONFIG CHECK option which will check the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE ‘Essential Med List for Review’ to make sure it holds certain HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENTs for which it was created in the first place.

> 5\. If an IRM staff member or the Clinical Coordinator needs access to all menus, give the Health Summary Overall Menu \[GMTS MANAGER\] to those users rather than assigning each menu option separately.

Function

Health Summary exports a function called GMTS COMPONENT NAME. It is used for writing the HEADER NAME, DEFAULT HEADER NAME, or COMPONENT NAME in Health Summary reports.

# Cross-References

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The number-space for Health Summary files is 142\*. Use the VA FileMan DATA DICTIONARY UTILITIES, option \#8 ( DILIST, List File Attributes), to print a list of these files. Depending on the FileMan template used to print the list, this option will print out all or part of the data dictionary for the GMTS files. If you choose the “Standard” format, you can see cross-reference information for a specified file(s).

# Purging and Archiving

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Archiving

> The Health Summary package does not provide archiving functionality because data is only stored for the Health Summary Type (#142), Health Summary Component (#142.1), and Health Summary Parameters (#142.99) files.

> The Health Summary package does not duplicate storage of VISTA ancillary package data. Data is extracted as needed from the ancillary packages, is temporarily stored in ^TMP(\<namespace\>,\$J, or ^UTILITY(\$J, and is deleted after the component has been printed or displayed.

> Purging

> The Delete Health Summary Type option \[GMTS TYPE DELETE\] is available on both the Coordinator’s and the Enhanced menus. The owner of a health summary type may delete it.

> Privacy Act laws specifically state that patient information in VISTA which is retrievable by patient identifier is part of the patient medical record. Printed Health Summary information is patient information that is retrievable by patient identifier and is considered part of the patient record. However, since the information on the Health Summary can be found elsewhere in the patient record, administrators in a Medical Center can choose whether or not to file hard copies of health summaries in the medical record. If you choose to file copies in the medical record, be aware that *information in a health summary is only a summary and may not be complete in many cases*.

# Callable Routines

Health Summary does not provide any publicly supported entry points. Included below is a list of entry points that are used by the Health Summary package. Use of these entry points by other packages requires a private Data Base Integration Agreement (DBIA) with Health Summary.

Other Kernel Print Options

Besides using the Kernel Installation & Distribution (KIDS) options to get lists of routines, files, etc., you can also use other Kernel options to print online technical information.

## Routines

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> The namespace for the Health Summary package is GMTS. Use the Kernel option, List Routines \[XUPRROU\], to print a list of any or all of the Health summary routines. This option is found on the Routine Tools \[XUPR-ROUTINE-TOOLS\] menu on the Programmer Options \[XUPROG\] menu, which is a sub-menu of the Systems Manager Menu \[EVE\] option.

> Example:

> Select Systems Manager Menu Option: programmer Options

> Select Programmer Options Option: routine Tools

> Select Routine Tools Option: list Routines

> Routine Print

> Want to start each routine on a new page: No// \<RET\>

> routine(s) ? \> GMTS\*

> The first line of each routine contains a brief description of the general function of the routine. Use the Kernel option, First Line Routine Print \[XU FIRST LINE PRINT\], to print a list of just the first line of each Health Summary subset routine.

> Example:

> Select Systems Manager Menu Option: programmer Options

> Select Programmer Options Option: routine Tools

> Select Routine Tools Option: First Line Routine Print

> PRINTS FIRST LINES

> routine(s) ? \> GMTS\*

## Globals

> ^GMT(142,

> ^GMT(142.1

> ^GMT(142.5,

> ^GMT(142.98,

> ^GMT(142.99,

> Use the Kernel option, List Global \[XUPRGL\], to print a list of any of these globals. This option is found on the Programmer Options menu \[XUPROG\], which is a sub-menu of the Systems Manager Menu \[EVE\] option.

> Example:

> Select Systems Manager Menu Option: programmer Options

> Select Programmer Options Option: LIST Global

> Global ^GMT\*

> Inquire To Option File

> The Kernel Inquire option \[XUINQUIRE\] provides the following information about a specified option(s).

- Option name.
- Menu text.
- Option description.
- Type of option.
- Lock (if any).

  In addition, all items on the menu are listed for each menu option.

## XINDEX

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

XINDEX is a routine that produces a report called the VA Cross-Referencer. This report is a technical and cross-reference listing of one routine or a group of routines. XINDEX provides a summary of errors and warnings for routines that do not comply with VA programming standards and conventions, a list of local and global variables and what routines they are referenced in, and a list of internal and external routine calls.

XINDEX is invoked from programmer mode: D ^XINDEX.

When selecting routines, select GMTS\* and exclude the routines GMTSI\* (the inits), GMTSON\* and GMTSO0\* (the onits).

# Data Dictionaries/ Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The number-spaces for Health Summary files are 142-. Use the VA FileMan DATA DICTIONARY UTILITIES, option \#8 ( DILIST, List File Attributes), to print a list of these files. Depending on the FileMan template used to print the list, this option will print out all or part of the data dictionary for the GMTS files.

List File Attributes

The FileMan List File Attributes option \[DILIST\] lets you generate documentation about files and file structure. If you choose the “Standard” format, you can see the following Data Dictionary information for a specified file(s).

- File name and description.
- Identifiers.
- Cross-references.
- Files pointed to by the file specified.
- Files that point to the file specified.
- Input templates.
- Print templates.
- Sort templates.

Example:

\>D P^DI

VA FileMan 21.0

Select OPTION: DATA DICTIONARY UTILITIES

Select DATA DICTIONARY UTILITY OPTION: LIST FILE ATTRIBUTES

START WITH WHAT FILE: 8925

(1 entry)

GO TO WHAT FILE: 8925// 8926\*

Select LISTING FORMAT: STANDARD// \[Enter\]

DEVICE: PRINTER

In addition, the following applicable data is supplied for each field in the file: field name, number, title, global location, description, help prompt, cross-reference(s), input transform, date last edited, and notes.

The “Global Map” format of this option generates an output that lists all cross-references for the file selected, global location of each field in the file, input templates, print templates, and sort templates.

# # Glossary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Ad Hoc Summary This is a temporary health summary that allows you to select health summary components, time and occurrence limits, and selection items for a particular patient.

> Components Elements of data from DHCP packages that make up the health summary report (e.g., Demographics).

> DHCP Decentralized Hospital Computer Program—previously the name for the VA program responsible for installing an integrated computer system in all DVA medical facilities. Now known as VISTA.

> Default Prompts that have an answer followed by double slashes (//) are called defaults; this means a response has been pre-selected, based on the most likely response or the previous response to this prompt. For example, the prompt “Time Limit:” may have a default of 1 year for Lab Orders and would appear as: Time Limit: 1Y//. Defaults save you time by allowing you to just hit return rather than typing an answer.

> Device A printer or a computer terminal screen. See the *DHCP Users Guide to Computing* for basic DHCP computer skills, including printing information.

> Hospital Location For some PCE components, when this

> Displayed flag is enabled, the Hospital Location abbreviation will be displayed.

> ICD Text Displayed For some components, Diagnosis Text can be customized (e. g., long form, short form, code only, or no form of ICD Diagnosis).

IB Encounter Form The Integrated Billing Package (Encounter

> Utilities Form Utilities) includes a Print Manager that allows sites to define reports that should print along with the encounter forms for a specific clinic or division and for specified appointments. One of the options, “Define Available Health Summary”, allows a Health Summary to be made available for use by the print manager. See the *IB Encounter Form Utilities User Manual* for further information.

> Lock Restricts edit access for a given health summary type to the holders of any valid security key. For example, the GMTSMGR key is required to edit summary types that are locked by the GMTSMGR lock.

> Non-destructive Health Summary components are non-destructive, meaning that the Health Summary package does not edit the data from the DHCP package where it extracts its information.

> Occurrence Limits The number of past occurrences that will be reported on a health summary (e.g., the last five occurrences).

> Owner The creator of a health summary type. Owners and holders of the GMTSMGR security key have sole access to modify their health summary type(s).

> Provider Narrative For some components, when this flag

> Displayed is enabled and a provider enters narrative text, the text will be displayed.

> Summary Order The order in which components appear in a health summary, as defined by the creator of a Summary Type.

> Summary Type The structure or template containing defined components and the unique characteristics with occurrence and time limits, and selection items. Used to print health summaries for patients.

> Time Limits The time period of reference included on a health summary for a particular component (e.g., 2D, 1M, 1Y for two days, one month and one year).

> VISTA The name for the VHA program responsible for installing an integrated computer system in all VHA medical facilities.

# # Appendix A—Defining New Components

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> We encourage sites to submit E3Rs for new components (or enhancements to existing components) that they believe will be useful on a national basis. The Health Summary Expert Panel (EP) will evaluate these requests. If the EP approves the request, these new components will be provided as patches or in a future version of the Health Summary package, depending on the priority that is given to the request.

> Sites have the option to create new components for Health Summary to provide for their site-specific needs. This may be an enhancement to one of the components that Health Summary provides, it can be a totally new one that accesses DHCP data that Health Summary currently doesn’t provide a component for, or it can be one to access non-DHCP supported (Class III software) packages.

> NOTE: Please be aware that locally created components are not supported by National VISTA Service (NVS) or Systems Design and Development (SD&D).

> A Health Summary basket has been set up on SHOP, ALL where sites can put their locally developed component routines, in order to share this information with the rest of the DHCP community. We encourage you to take a look at what has already been done, as this may save you some time.

> *To access SHOP,ALL from FORUM:*

1.  Enter SHOP,ALL at your menu prompt and you’ll be “logged” on to SHOP,ALL
2.  Enter SURROGATE NAME: SHOP,ALL
3.  Select Mailman Option: Read Mail
4.  Enter the Health Summary mail basket.

> We would also like you to add any components you have created locally to SHOP,ALL .

> Format for Adding Components to SHOP,ALL

> If you have components you would like to share, please use the following instructions/format.

> 1\. Start the subject of the message with:

> HS Vx.x -- brief subject/component name, where x.x will be the version

> 2\. Include a description, sample of the report, and the routines to produce the report. The routine should be under the name-space assigned to your station; e.g., Madison=ALW, Cincinnati=AFR.

> 3\. The message will go to the IN Basket at SHOP,ALL. The SHOP,ALL administrators will read the IN basket daily and save the message to a basket called Health Summary.

> Hints for Developing local site components

> Before writing your own components, review some of the existing routines that have been written. Some good examples are the Patient Care Encounter, the Discharge Summary, or the Compensation and Pension components with the display routines in the Health Summary name space and the extract routines in the custodial package’s name-space. We suggest that when creating new components, you write two separate routines, one to extract the data and one to display the data. The display routine will call the extract routine and then display the data that was extracted.

> Put any local routines you develop in your site’s routine name-space.

> Local site components will be entered into the Health Summary Component (File \#142.1) file with an internal file number beginning with your site number plus an additional 3 digits (e.g. At Salt Lake VAMC the first number would be 660001). This is to assure that nationally developed components are not overlaid by local site-developed components or vice versa. You will be prompted with a valid number when you enter a new component via the

> Create/Modify Health Summary Components option on the Health Summary Maintenance Menu.

> For the extract routine, we recommend that you set the data to the ^TMP("name",\$J) global. The display routine will get the data from this global and display/print it. For the extract routine, you call it with the DFN (Patient Internal File Number) variable. Optionally, you could set it up for time and occurrence limits. GMTSEND (FileMan date to be used as the ending date for displaying data, GMTSBEG (FileMan date to be used as the beginning date for displaying data, and GMTSNDM (Maximum number of occurrences to display) are the variables to use to allow for time and occurrence limits. In your extract routine, make sure the date of the data is between the dates in the GMTSBEG and GMTSEND variables. Use the GMTSNDM variable to make sure you only get the maximum number of records that were entered for the occurrence limits.

> Depending on how the cross-references are set up in the file you are extracting data from, you may want to use the reverse \$ORDER M command or a cross-reference with an inverted FileMan date to get the most recent data first. When putting the data into the ^TMP global, you can invert the date (9999999-Date) as one of the subscripts. Or you can just include the date. When displaying the data, you will need to use the Reverse \$ORDER M command to get the most recent data to display first, if you don’t use an inverted date subscript.

> NOTE: Inverted FileMan dates mean that the date (e.g. 2950630) will be subtracted from 9999999. This would give you 7049369. Inverted FileMan dates are used to order the data from most recent data to oldest data. With the Reverse \$ORDER command, this convention won’t necessarily need to be followed in the future. Prior to the Reverse \$ORDER M command, it was necessary to put the retrieved data in the ^TMP array with a subscript in Inverted FileMan Date/time in order that the user would see the most current data first in the Health Summary display.

> Once you have extracted the data, you can print or display it. To allow for page breaks (and in the interactive display the capability to terminate or jump to another component), it is important that you issue the following commands before printing a line of data.

> D CKP^GMTSUP Q:\$D(GMTSQIT)

> If this isn’t done before each line is written, the length of the document may exceed the length of the page or screen. You also will not get the component header to display before displaying the data. It is important that no lines are written, and the above commands are not issued if there is no data. For version 2.7 of Health Summary we implemented the capability to suppress component headers and “No Data Available” messages for Health Summary Types. In order to make this work, the CKP^GMTSUP routine was updated to set a flag that data was printed for a component. After the Health Summary driver processes each component for a Health Summary Type, the system checks to see if data was displayed for the component. If no data was displayed, the driver determines whether or not to display the component header and “No Data Available” messages.

> NOTE: For any local site components that were written prior to version 2.7, if you want to be able to suppress component headers and “No Data Available” messages, you will need to evaluate them and remove calls to BREAK^GMTSUP. This command should not be executed within your routines and you should not display the message that there was no data available. You also want to be sure not to execute CKP^GMTSUP until you have data to display.

> *Setting up a component to allow selection of specific items*

> If you want to set up a component to allow selection of specific items, review one of the existing components that allows this capability, then follow these steps.

1.  Add “GMTS” to the Application Group field for the file you want to select items from. You can do this through FileMan with the Edit File option under the Utility Functions option.
2.  Add the pointed to file to the variable pointer Selection Item (field \#4) sub-field in the multiple Structure (Field \#1) field in the Health Summary Type (file \#142) file. Do this through FileMan with the Modify File Attributes option.
3.  When entering a new component to the Health Summary Component (file \#142.1), be sure to enter the File to the Selection Item field. This can be done through the Create/Modify Health Summary Components option on the Health Summary Maintenance Menu.
4.  In your application code, access the GMTSEG variable to determine the Selection Items for the file. The format of this array is GMTSEG(GMTSEGN,file number,Selection Item internal file number). GMTSEGN is the internal file number for the component. You can \$ORDER on the third subscript of the array and get the Selection Item’s internal file number. In your extract routine you will then limit the extract to only retrieve records for the specified Selection Items.

> NOTE: Typically, users at sites should not modify files. However, in order to include new components with selection items, it is necessary to modify a file’s structure. Therefore, we recommend extreme caution while following the procedures above.

  
Create/Modify Health Summary Components

> The following sample dialogue can assist you in creating your own local health summary components.

> NOTE: When selecting components from the Ad Hoc Health Summary menu, entering “ALL” allows all components to be selected. If the first three characters of a Header Name for a component are designated as “All”, however, then only the defined component will be selected. Avoid conflicts and loss of functionality by not using “all” at the front of new header names.

# Appendix BHealth Summary Security

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Health summaries produced by this package are highly confidential and should be treated with the same security precautions as a patient’s medical record.

## Menu Access

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> The Health Summary Overall Menu \[GMTS MANAGER\] contains four menus.

> 1\. GMTS USER

> 2\. GMTS ENHANCED USER

> 3\. GMTS COORDINATOR

> 4\. GMTS IRM/ADPAC MAINT MENU

> Assign these menus as follows. (See the *Health Summary User Manual* for complete user descriptions of menus and options).

> 1\. Give the Health Summary Menu \[GMTS USER\] menu to users who only need to print or display health summaries.

> 2\. Give the Health Summary Enhanced Menu \[GMTS ENHANCED USER\] menu to users who need to create, modify, or delete their *own* health summary types, in addition to printing health summaries.

> 3\. Give the Health Summary Coordinator’s Menu \[GMTS COORDINATOR\] menu to users who need to print or display health summaries, and who will also need to create, modify, or delete health summary types, and set up nightly batch printing at specified locations.

5.  <span id="GMTS_2_7_94_PS_MED_RECON_CONFIG_CHK2" class="anchor"></span>Give the Health Summary Maintenance Menu \[GMTS IRM/ADPAC MAINT MENU\] to IRM staff or the Clinical Coordinator for any implementation and maintenance issues in Health Summary. This menu contains options to disable/enable health summary components for selection/display, create/modify new health summary components, edit and rebuild the Ad Hoc Health Summary Type, re-sequence the components in a health summary type, create/modify a health summary type, delete a health summary type, and edit health summary site parameters. With the release of GMTS\*2.7\*94 patch, it also contains a new GMTS PS MED RECON CONFIG CHECK option which will check the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE ‘Essential Med List for Review’ to make sure it holds certain HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENTs for which it was created in the first place.

## Security

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Security is established via a combination of the GMTSMGR and GMTS VIEW ONLY security keys and the OWNER and LOCK fields in File 142 (Health Summary Type file).

> <u>GMTSMGR Security Key</u>

> The GMTSMGR security key allows holders to override the LOCK and OWNER access restrictions for editing health summary types. The IRM Chief and Health Summary Coordinators are likely holders of this key.

> This security key allows the holder to edit general usage health summary types which are locked with the GMTSMGR key. It also provides master edit access to all other health summary types.

> <u>GMTS VIEW ONLY Security Key</u>

> The GMTS VIEW ONLY key allows holders to view a health summary on the CRT. Holders may use all of the familiar Health Summary options but will not be prompted for a device for printing paper copies of the health summary.

## Health Summary Type File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Owner

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Owners of health summary types have edit access to health summary types they have created. The owner is designated when a health summary type is created. Usually the creator of a health summary type is automatically designated as its owner. However, if creators of heath summary types hold the GMTSMGR key, they may designate another person as the owner. If you are assigned the GMTSMGR key, you are *not* automatically designated as the owner. You may, however, enter your name as the “owner.”

### Lock

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> This field can be used to specify a security key and is designated when the health summary type is created. This lock gives edit access for that health summary type to anyone who holds the matching security key. For example, someone creating a Pathology Health Summary Type may want to enter LRSUPER as the lock, thereby giving edit access to any holder of the LRSUPER security key. The four health summary types exported with the Health Summary package have the GMTSMGR lock.

> A lock does not restrict an owner the lock gives permission. If a health summary type is locked, the owner of the health summary type is not required to have the key to access it; however, all other users must have the key.

## Health Summary Object File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Creator

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Creators of health summary objects have edit access to health summary objects they have created. The creator is designated when a health summary object is created.

## Health Summary Component File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Lock

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> You may restrict any component from view by entering the name of a valid security key in the LOCK field for a given component. For example, if your site decides that only holders of the LRSPUSER key should be allowed to view the Surgical Pathology Health Summary component, then entering the name of that security key in the LOCK field of that component’s record will enforce that policy.

## VA FileMan File Protection

<span id="Patch_GMTS_2_7_114_Cleanup" class="anchor"></span>Patch GMTS\*2.7\*144 Cleanup for Multiple Releases

This patch and its associated supporting patches correct post-deployment issues with Sexual Orientation 1.0, CPRS v32b, and Self-Identified Gender Identity (SIGI). The following issues are addressed:

1.  The MAS DEMOGRAPHICS OTHER (DEMC) component is renamed to MAS DEM. SEXUAL ORIENTATION (DEMS), so users know what information the component displays.
2.  A new type named VA-MAS DEM SEXUAL ORIENTATION and a new object named VA-MAS DEM SEXUAL ORIENTATION (TIU) are created, which allows other packages to use the MAS DEM. SEXUAL ORIENTATION component.
3.  A new component named MAS DEMOGRAPHICS PRONOUNS (DEMP) is created, which will display a patient's preferred pronouns. Additionally, a new type named VA-MAS DEM PRONOUNS and a new object named VA-MAS DEM PRONOUNS (TIU) are created, which allow other packages to use the new component.
4.  A new component named MAS DEMOGRAPHICS GENDER ID (DEMG) is created , which will display a patient's gender identity. Additionally a new type named VA-MAS DEM GENDER IDENTITY and a new object named VA-MAS DEM GENDER IDENTITY (TIU) are created, which allow other packages to use the new component.
5.  Contraindication and refusal information are added to the following components:

> PCE IMMUNIZATIONS (IM)

> PCE IMMUNIZATIONS DETAILED (DIM)

> PCE IMMUNIZATIONS SELECT CHRON (SIMC)

> PCE IMMUNIZATIONS SELECTED (SIM)

> PCE IMMUN SELECT REVERSE CHRON (SIMR)

<span id="Patch_GMTS_2_7_115_Updates" class="anchor"></span>Patch GMTS\*2.7\*115 Updates for Indication for Use on EMLR Health Summary Ad hoc Reports

GMTS\*2.7\*115 is installed as part of the CPRS v32b release. This patch introduces the support for New Service Request (NSR) 20100101, related to Essential Medication List for Review (EMLR) Health Summary Ad hoc Reports MRR1, MRT1, RXOP, RXDC and RXOI. The indication for use for the medication orders, if available, will display now on these health summary objects/reports.

<span id="GMTS_2_7_141" class="anchor"></span>Patch GMTS\*2.7\*141 update releases an Ad-Hoc Health Summary Component that will display sexual orientation data from the PATIENT (#2) file. Specifically, the SEXUAL ORIENTATION (#.025) multiple field and the SEXUAL ORIENTATION DESCRIPTION (#.0251) field, where appropriate.

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*125 Updates for Health Summary Components

GMTS\*2.7\*125 will be installed with patches PSN\*4\*567 and PSS\*1\*234, to release two new national Health Summary components that can be used to create objects or in Ad hoc reporting.

The components will allow selecting Outpatient prescriptions by drug class (VA classification) or by Pharmacy Orderable Item name. The component names are RXDC for drug classes and RXOI for Orderable Items.

<span id="Patch_GMTS_2_7_94_Updates" class="anchor"></span>Patch GMTS\*2.7\*94 Updates for the Essential Med List for Review

GMTS\*2.7\*94 will be installed with PSO\*7\*314 to correct issues reported with the Tool \#1: Medication Reconciliation. The Health Summary patch GMTS\*2.7\*94 will create a national entry in the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) for Tool \#1: Med. Reconciliation (the abbreviation is MRT1).

Furthermore, a replica of the Tool \#1 Medication Reconciliation called Medication Reconciliation No Glossary Tool \#1 (the abbreviation is MRR1) will be created. The only difference between the two components is whether the Health Summary has a glossary. In the Essential Med List for Review Health Summary type, the site can use either the MRT1 component if they want the glossary at the end of the Health Summary, or if the site uses the MRR1 component, the same Health Summary will be displayed without the glossary at the end of the report.

Another feature recently added was to include all Dispense Drug data, including BCMA Last Action, into the report for Inpatient Medication data which incorporates Dosage information as well.

The GMTS\*2.7\*94 patch changes include the following:

1.  Usage of data from other VA pharmacies via Remote Data Interoperability

> (RDI) updated to include prescriptions where the status is “HOLD”.

2.  The Essential Med List for Review was upated to retrieve all necessary BCMA actions, particularly for large volume IVs.
3.  Corrected the service for Clinic Medications that used to show the service as “INPT”. The service for Clinic Medications now reads “CLIN”.
4.  Ensured that the most recent order information was being correctly gathered. The change involved looking at the correct field in the prescription information and no longer infer that the latest expiration date implied the latest prescription.
5.  The tool was modified to display multiple line provider comments in a more readable fashion.
6.  The program was updated to assume that DoD prescriptions with an issue date more than 1 year in the past must be, by definition, now expired or discontinued and will no longer be considered “ACTIVE” even though that is precisely what is returned by the CHDR data.
7.  The section of the report that showed “Other medications previously dispensed in the last year” was misleading. For example, prescriptions with no refills that were over 120 days old would not display at all. In some cases, this led to the belief that the Sig that was displaying was incorrect. The section in question has been removed from the report and the medications needed for the report were incorporated into the main body of the report.
8.  The code was modified to recognize the On Call property flag for IV types of admixtures.
9.  The following changes were also made:
- Introductory text changed to describe what the report contains, what is does not contain, and that it specify what remote data is shown
- Remote data warnings that give some information about why remote data may not display
- Changes in the status names (Hold changed to On Hold, Suspended changed to Active/Suspended, etc)
- Rx# added to active outpatient prescriptions
- QTY added to days supply for outpatient
- Status added to inpatient entries
- Additive strength added to Intravenous Piggyback (IVPB) orders
- Added pending orders to inpatient and outpatient
- INP changed to INPT and OPT changed to OUTPT
- Added additive strength and bags/day to inpatient IV Adm
- Added status, admin rate, dose and freq to IVPBs, including number of bags per order
- Added volume and rate of infusion to IV Adms
- Supplies now separated from medications list

<span id="patch88" class="anchor"></span>Patch GMTS\*2.7\*120 – HEALTH SUMMARY UPDATE FOR Medication Reconciliation Tool \#2 (MRT2)

Currently, on the MRT2 non-VA medications do not display in the same manner as VA-prescribed medications. Patch GMTS\*2.7\*120 removes the inconsistencies in the display on the patient-facing report generated from the Health Summary data and given to the patient when admitted, discharged, or transferred. Per the Joint Commission's NPSG.03.06.01, a medication summary must be given to a patient upon each admission, discharge or transfer. The document used currently does not display non-VA medication information as thoroughly as it does VA medications. Even when all information is available, the MRT2 report does not present the Non-VA meds consistently. In fact, there is no 'worksheet space' available for the non-VA medications.

Note that non-VA medication orders are not required to have all the same fields as a VA prescribed medication.

An example of a complete patient-facing report using health summary information is as follows:

![](health-summary-version-2-7-technical-manual/007.png)

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*111 – HEALTH SUMMARY UPDATE FOR ICD-10 PTF PROJECT

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*111 updates the following Health Summary Components (#142.1) to include an expanded number of diagnosis codes (1 primary and up to 24 secondary diagnoses), operation/surgery codes (up to 25), and procedure codes (up to 25) that may be present in the Patient Treatment File (PTF):

- MAS ADMISSIONS/DISCHARGES
- MAS ADT HISTORY EXPANDED
- MAS DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS
- MAS PROCEDURES ICD CODES
- MAS SURGERIES ICD CODES

Any of the following locally created items will also be affected by the newly updated display capability included in this patch if those items leverage any of the affected components to generate output:

- Health Summary Types
- Health Summary Objects
- TIU/Health Summary Objects
- OE/RR Reports

Objects may be of particular interest as the newly expanded display would be more noticeable when an object is embedded in areas such as boilerplate text, note templates, and reminder dialog templates.

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*111 also updates the following reports that utilize one or more of the aforementioned Health Summary Components and will therefore now display the expanded data fields as appropriate:

- HEALTH SUMMARY (#142)
  - REMOTE DEMO/VISITS/PCE (1Y)
  - REMOTE DEMO/VISITS/PCE (3M)
  - REMOTE DIS SUM/SURG/PROD (12Y)
- OE/RR REPORT (#101.24)
  - ORRPW ADT ADM DC
  - ORRPW ADT DC DIAG
  - ORRPW ADT EXP
  - ORRPW ADT ICD PROC
  - ORRPW ADT ICD SURG
  - ORRPW DOD ADT EXP

GMTS\*2.7\*29 – REMOTE DATA VIEWS

GMTS\*2.7\*48 – REMOTE ONCOLOGY VIEW

Health Summary patches 29 and 48 export components for using Remote Data Views. With all the proper patches installed, you may view remote patient data through CPRS. Before you can do this, you must have Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics (MPI/PD) and several other patches installed. Once these are in place and the proper parameters have been set, you can access remote data from other VA facilities.

Currently, remote data views are limited to predefined, nationally exported Health Summary Types. Remote data may not be viewed by either the Ad Hoc Health Summary type or locally/user developed Health Summary types.

You can view remote clinical data using any Health Summary Type that has an identically named Health Summary Type installed at both the local and remote sites. However, for non-nationally exported health summary reports, the content of the report is subject to the report structure and configuration defined at the remote site.

GMTS\*2.7\*45 – INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRESS NOTES

The purpose of this patch is to allow the Health Summary components 'Progress Notes' and 'Selected Progress Notes' to display the new interdisciplinary progress notes and all of the entries associated with the interdisciplinary note. The interdisciplinary note and all of the associated entries will be marked in the progress note components as follows.

<u>Note Type Marked as</u>

Primary Note Interdisciplinary Note

Addendum to Primary Interdisciplinary Note (addendum)

Child Note Interdisciplinary Note Entry

Addendum to Child Interdisciplinary Note Entry (addendum)

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*47 - CPRS Report Tab/NDBI/Misc Fixes

A menu of options has been added, CPRS Reports Tab “Health Summary Types List,” that allows users to control the Health Summary Types and the order that the Health Summary Types are listed in the Health Summary Types box on the Reports Tab of CPRS. This menu option has four menu items to edit and display the users’ preferences.

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*48 - REMOTE ONCOLOGY VIEW

This patch exports the REMOTE ONCOLOGY VIEW Health Summary Type and

installs it in the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE file (#142), providing Remote

Data Views of Oncology Data. It also conducts a check to make sure

the Oncology Component is installed in the Patient Data Exchange's (PDX)

VAQ - DATA SEGMENT file (#394.71). This provides two methods for health

care providers and cancer registrars to request and view oncology data

on a patient seen at multiple sites: Remote Data Views for CPRS (GUI)

users and Patient Data Exchange for List Manager users.

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*49 - Demographics/HS Types List

A menu of options has been added, “CPRS Health Summary Display/Edit Site Defaults,” that allows IRM/Managers to control which Health Summary Types are on the reports tab and the order that the Health Summary Types appear in for the site. These site defaults will be used for users who do not have personal preferences set. This menu has four menu items to edit and display defaults for the site.

GMTS\*2.7\*89 SUPPORT OF CLINICAL REMINDERS ENHANCEMENTS

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*90 - ADD EARLIEST APPROPRIATE DATE TO HS ADHOC REPORT

Addition of the EARLIEST APPROPRIATE DATE (New Service Request 20051008) to the Health Summary Ad hoc CNB - Brief Consults Report.

The EARLIEST APPROPRIATE DATE is the earliest appropriate date that the patient should be seen. This data field was added with CPRS v28.

GMTS\*2.7\*91 - MHAL AND MHAS COMPONENTS NOT SHOWING ALL ADMININISTRATIONS

This patch will correct a defect in the MHAL and MHAS Health Summary components where all Mental Health instruments administered through the CPRS GUI do not display.

GMTS\*2.7\*92 - CORRECTIONS TO MEDICATION WORKSHEET (TOOL \#2)

This patch will correct a defect in the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) and creates a national entry for Tool \#2: Medication Worksheet. Hard-coding of patient Social Security number has been removed and now all control of patient identifiers is controlled by the parameters set at the Health Summary Type level, consistent with other Class I software.

This patch also resolves the issue of the wrong pharmacy division printing on report headers by modifying internal programming. The internal programming that selects the name of the pharmacy division shown at the top of the worksheet and the pharmacy phone number associated with it has been revised. At facilities where there are multiple entries in OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) that share the same SITE NUMBER, the Medication Worksheet is unable to distinguish between these entries in order to choose the correct pharmacy name and phone number for display in the report header. In these cases, the result may be that the displayed name and phone number are for a division other than the pharmacy’s preferred phone number for patient calls.

It also corrects a known issue from the initial release of Medication Reconciliation by adding status of HOLD to the Medication Worksheet.

GMTS\*2.7\*93 - COMBINE UNITS ON TRANSFUSION REPORT

This patch fixes a problem with the Blood Transfusion Report when using the report on a system running VBECS (Vista Blood Establishment Computer Software). The problem reported is that multiple units transfused on the same day were not being totaled but were rather displayed as separate lines for each transfused unit.

This patch corrects the problem by correctly totaling the units the way it did prior to VBECS.

This patch also adds Legacy Vista Data to the Blood Transfusion report. Prior to this change only transfusion data newly entered into VBECS were showing in the report. To see Legacy Vista Data, on the report, the parameter OR VBECS LEGACY REPORT has to be set to YES.

GMTS\*2.7\*95 – CORRECT B CROSS-REFERENCE

The NAME field (.01) of the HEALTH SUMMARY OBJECTS file (#142.5) had a 'B' cross-reference that only stored the first 30 characters of the name. When attempting to install a TIU/HS Object in Clinical Reminder Exchange, a FileMan error: "The update failed, UPDATE^DIE returned the following error message" would occur when the receiving site has multiple Health Summary Object entries that are not unique until after the 30-character length.

This patch corrects this problem by modifying the 'B' cross-reference to store the full 60 characters.

GMTS\*2.7\*99 – HIGH RISK MENTAL HEALTH PATIENT – NATIONAL REMINDER AND FLAG

This patch is in support of the Improve Veteran Mental Health (IVMH) initiative, High Risk Mental Health (HRMH) - National Reminder & Flag. This patch will install four Health Summary Components, two Health Summary Types, a single Health Summary Object, and a single TIU/Health Summary object. The TIU/HS object will be used in the VA-MH HIGH RISK NO SHOW FOLLOW-UP Reminder Dialog distributed in PXRM\*2\*18.

New Components, Types, and Objects in GMTS\*2.7\*99

Four new entries are added to HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT (#142.1).

1.  MAS CONTACTS - This component will display contact phone numbers for the patient along with contact information for emergency and NOK contacts, if available.
2.  MAS MH CLINIC VISITS FUTURE - This component uses a Reminder Location List to help find the next appointment for the patient in any mental health clinic.
3.  MH HIGH RISK PRF HX - This component will display current assignment status and assignment history of the Category II (local) High Risk for Suicide Patient Record Flag.
4.  MH TREATMENT COORDINATOR - This component will display the Mental Health Treatment Coordinator assigned to this patient.

Two new entries are added to HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE (#142).

1.  VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT - This Type contains the four Health Summary Components mentioned above and is the basis for creating the VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT (TIU) Health Summary Object.
2.  REMOTE HIGH RISK MH PATIENT - This Type contains the same components as \#1 and allows viewing the aforementioned information from remote sites.

One new entry is added to HEALTH SUMMARY OBJECT (#142.5).

1.  VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT (TIU) - This object is created from the VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT Health Summary Type and allows embedding the aforementioned information into a document. Its primary use here is to allow creation of the VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT TIU/HS object for use in the VA-MH HIGH RISK NO SHOW FOLLOW-UP Reminder Dialog.

One new entry is added to TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1).

1.  VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT - This object makes the information found in the VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT Health Summary Type available for use in Reminder Dialogs and other documents.

GMTS\*2.7\*100 -PROBLEM WITH NEW MED WORKSHEET REPORT

The Medication Worksheet report in CPRS displayed a patient’s previous prescription Patient Instruction Signature comments in subsequent prescriptions, displaying incorrect Patient Instruction Signature comments for that prescription.

Routine GMTSPST2 has been modified to clear a prescription's signature lines before displaying a subsequent prescription.

<span id="patch102" class="anchor"></span>Patch GMTS\*2.7\*102 – MENTAL HEALTH CLEANUP

The Mental Health package version 5.01 patch 60 (YS\*5.01\*60) removes

functionality from the Mental Health package that is no longer in use.

Specifically, patch YS\*5.01\*60 removes the MEDICAL RECORD file (file

\#90), which the MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL EXAM health summary component

relies upon. Patch GMTS\*2.7\*102 will accomplish the following.

1.  Deactivate the MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL EXAM health summary component.
2.  Rebuild the Health Summary Ad hoc Report (the GMTS HS ADHOC OPTION health summary type).
3.  Email a usage report containing the following listings.
1.  Health summary types that contain the MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL EXAM health summary component
2.  Health summary objects that contain the health summary types listed in (a)

<span id="gmts104" class="anchor"></span>Patch GMTS\*2.7\*104 – MHTC & CAT 1 PRF UPDATE TO HIGH RISK MH PATIENT HEALTH SUMMARY REPORT

This patch is in support of Phase II of the Improve Veteran Mental Health (IVMH) initiative, High Risk Mental Health Patient (HRMHP) - National Reminder & Flag project.

This patch will modify two entries in the Health Summary Component file (142.1):

MH HIGH RISK PRF HX and MH TREATMENT COORDINATOR.

These components are used in the VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT and REMOTE MH

HIGH RISK PATIENT Health Summaries; as well as being available for use in the Health Summary Ad hoc Report.

Additionally, the VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT Health Summary is embedded in the VA-MH HIGH RISK NO SHOW FOLLOW-UP Clinical Reminder Dialog which was released in Phase I of this project.

The MH HIGH RISK PRF HX component includes the assignment history

for the newly created Category I Patient Record Flag (HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE). The assignment history in Health Summary displays both Category II (local) and Category I (National) assignments for High Risk for Suicide. Once all local entries have been converted to the national flag, you should only see the Category I Patient Record Flag.

The MH TREATMENT COORDINATOR component has been activated with this patch and will display the Mental Health treatment Team, Mental Health Treatment4 Coordinator (MHTC), and the MHTC contact information.

Sample output from the updated components.

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*107 – BUG FIXES - iMED NOTE, IMPORT HS OBJECT, VITALS TEXT

This patch will resolve the following issues in the Health Summary package.

1.  INC000000418117 - Imed Consent note shows as unsigned
1.  Problem

The problem occurs when the user selects either Heath summary component "SPN" (Selected Progress notes) or "PN" (Progress notes). If the user selects a "scanned document," VistA will append the text "\< THE ABOVE NOTE IS UNSIGNED \>" and "\* DRAFT COPY \*" to the bottom of the report even though scanned documents do not require a signature and are not drafts.

2.  Resolution

Stopped the text from being appended on scanned documents that have an administrative closure date.

Routine GMTSPN2 has been modified to check the TIU Document File. If the "ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSURE MODE" (1613) field is set to 'S' FOR scanned document, and "ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSURE DATE" (1606) has a value, the note will be excluded from having the unwanted text appended.

2.  INC000000752225 - ADHOC HS Vital Signs Detailed Display issue
1.  Problem

When pain value of 99 is entered in vitals, the ADHOC Health Summary components (\[VS\] "Vital Signs," \[VSD\] "Vital Signs Detailed Display," and \[SVS\] "Vital Signs Selected") show the text "No Response.” When you view the same info via the Vitals Cumulative report, it correctly shows the text as "Unable to Respond.” No response to pain and unable to respond are two clinically different things.

2.  Resolution

Changed the components to display "Unable to Respond"

Routines GMTSVS, GMTSVSD, and GMTSVSS have been modified to write "Unable to Respond." GMTSVS was also modified to move Pain score to a new third line. GMTSVSS was also modified to allot more space (18 characters) for Pain score.

3.  INC000000784073 - Importing HS Object Questions
1.  Problem

When using the \[GMTS OBJ EXPORT\] option in VistA, if one of the components used in the Health Summary type is a local component or has selected Items, the process completes with no error reported. However, when the receiving CAC tries to use the imported object, it fails to work. If VistA identifies the component as a local component or one that has selected Items, it simply omits the component without any type of error or warning.

2.  Resolution

Modified VistA to return an error message and abort the export if the CAC tries to export a Health Summary Object that is associated with a Health Summary Type with a local component or selected items component. The following error messages were approved by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup.

- "Cannot export a Health Summary Object using a Health Summary Type that contains Local Health Summary Components"
- "Health Summary Type \<TYPE\> contains Local Health Summary Component \<COMPONENT\>"

<span id="patch101" class="anchor"></span>Patch GMTS\*2.7\*101 - ICD-10 - Health Summary Updates

This patch is part of the Computerized Patient Records System CPRSv30 project. This project will modify the Computerized Patient Record System, Text Integration Utilities, Consults, Health Summary, Problem List, Clinical Reminders, and Order Entry/Results Reporting to meet the requirements proposed by the Dept. of Health and Human Services

to adopt ICD-10 code set standards Clinic Orders. This patch makes all changes to Health Summary that are required to move from the ICD-9 coding version to ICD-10.

- Health Summary reports will differentiate between ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes for diagnosis information that was coded using the ICD-9 or ICD-10 code set (not entered via free text) in CPRS. Ad hoc reports allow the user to choose the Health Summary Components to include in the report. These reports can also display diagnosis information that users entered via other CPRS packages.
- Health Summary Reports will print the ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis or procedure diagnosis that was captured for the patient at the time the diagnosis was entered in CPRS and in the online report users entered via other CPRS packages.

Patch GMTS\*2.7\*111 - ICD-10 PTF Modifications - Health Summary Updates

As part of the ICD-10 remediation effort for the VistA Admissions Discharge Transfer (ADT) module, DG\*5.3\*884 increased the maximum number of diagnosis, procedure, and operation codes that could be stored with a given entry in the PTF file (#45). This Health Summary patch will update the following Health Summary Components (#142.1) to include the expanded fields as indicated.  Any Health Summary Type, Health Summary Object, TIU/HS Object, or OE/RR REPORT (#101.24) that uses these components as a basis for data will see the expanded fields (if populated) in the report output.

- MAS ADMISSIONS/DISCHARGES – Updated to display up to 25 diagnosis codes with each occurrence.
- MAS ADT HISTORY EXPANDED – Updated to display up to 25 diagnosis codes, up to 25 procedure codes, and up to 25 operation codes.
- MAS DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS – Updated to display up to 25 diagnosis codes with each occurrence.
- MAS PROCEDURES ICD CODES – Updated to display up to 25 procedure codes with each occurrence.
- MAS SURGERIES ICD CODES – Updated to display up to 25 operation codes with each occurrence.
