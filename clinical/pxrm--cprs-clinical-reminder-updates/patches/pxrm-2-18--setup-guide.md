The purpose of this project is to release 1) two new Scheduling reports that identify no-show “high risk for suicide” patients that missed their MH appointments, 2) a new national reminder and reminder dialog that will be used by providers to document results of following up with a high risk for suicide patient that missed a MH appointment, and 3) provide a health summary type with MH-specific supporting information. This functionality is in Increment 1 and 2 of the High Risk MH Patient – Reminder and Flag project.
The first release of the High Risk Mental Health Patient- Reminder and Flag (HRMHP) project includes five patches, which will be installed as a combined build, HIGH RISK MH 1.0. This Installation Guide describes installing and setting up Increments 1 and 2. Increments 3 and 4 will be released in a future build.
SD\*5.3\*578
This Scheduling patch provides two new MH NO SHOW Scheduling Reports for use by Suicide Prevention Coordinators and other Mental Health professionals. The reports will support following up with High Risk for Suicide patients who missed a scheduled MH appointment.
DG\*5.3\*836
This Registration Patient Record Flag patch provides new interfaces used by the Scheduling and Reminder patches to determine the High Risk for Suicide flag status on a specified date.
PXRM\*2\*18
This patch will create a national reminder to notify clinicians of a patient's risk of suicide and will create a dialog the clinicians can use to document follow-up with the high risk patients when they miss MH appointments. This Clinical Reminder patch supports the Scheduling patch by providing a national Reminder Location List of Mental Health stop codes used for scheduled appointments. Additionally, this patch includes miscellaneous clinical reminder maintenance changes. Details of all the Clinical Reminder changes can be found in the Release Notes.
GMTS\*2.7\*99
This patch installs four Health Summary Components (MAS CONTACTS, MAS MH CLINIC VISITS, MH HIGH RISK PRF HX, and MH TREATMENT COORDINATOR), two Health Summary Types (VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT and REMOTE HIGH RISK MH PATIENT),, and a single Health Summary Object(VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT (TIU)).
TIU\*1\*260
This patch will install one new Object into the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (8925.1): MH MISSED APPOINTMENTS 10D.
MH MISSED APPOINTMENTS 10D is used by the VA-MH HIGH RISK NO SHOW
FOLLOW-UP reminder dialog to display any No-Show or No-Show and Rescheduled mental health clinic appointments for the past 10 days.
This High Risk MH build can be installed with users on the system. Installation will take between 5 and 15 minutes. A number of Clinical Reminders Exchange entries will be installed and the installer may be prompted for replacement items. Because of this, the build should not be queued and the site's Clinical Reminders manager should be on hand during the install. Details about these Exchange entries can be found below.

## IMPORTANT – The reminder term VA-MHV INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION will be installed with the overwrite action, which means that all locally mapped findings will be removed. Therefore, prior to the installation, sites should use the “Inquire about Reminder Term” option to check this term and verify that it has been mapped with your local findings.  If there are no mapped local findings, then after this install, add proper local mappings to complete this reminder term’s definition.  If there are local mapped findings in the reminder definition, save the output of the term inquiry for this term into something permanent (such as a document). After the installation, the term will have a single mapped finding, which will look similar to this:

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

                  Finding Item: INFLUENZA, HIGH DOSE SEASONAL, PRESERV-FREE 

                                (FI(1)=IM(612013))                           

                  Finding Type: IMMUNIZATION

           Beginning Date/Time: 8/20/10

Use the saved term inquiry as a reference and add back the locally mapped findings that were removed.  Do not remove the mapped finding that was installed by the patch.

# Pre-Installation

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Pre-Install Setup Steps:We recommend that the team who will be responsible for implementing this project coordinate before installing the patches, to determine the first two pre-install steps. This team could include MH coordinators, Suicide Prevention Coordinators, Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs), Reminders Managers, and IRM staff.

1.  (IRM staff or CAC): Check to see if there is a local Patient Record Flag entry for “HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE.” Open the “Record Flag Management” menu option on the “Patient Record Flags Main Menu,” and then use the Change Category (CC) action to switch to Flag Category II (Local) and see what’s listed as local flags.  HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE was the PRF name recommended by VHA Directive 2008-036, dated July 18, 2008.

> During the DG\*5.3\*836 install, IRM staff will be asked:

> Do you want to update the Parameter Definition for the local Patient Record Flag related to HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE at this time? YES//

> Enter the Local Patient Record Flag that you are using as your "High Risk

> for Suicide" flag. If not already defined use the Directive

> recommendation: HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE. If already defined use your current

> flag name.

> Recommended Flag: HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE Replace

2.  (IRM staff, Mental Health Coordinator, or CAC) During the SD\*5.3\*578 install, IRM staff will be asked to enter the name for the mail group owner of the new mail group SD MH NO SHOW NOTIFICATION. The owner assigned will be responsible for entering the names of Suicide Prevention Coordinators and/or other MH professionals into the Mail Group. Sites can decide who this owner should be – an IRM staff member, a CAC, or one of the MH-SPC team. Check to see if there’s a mail group expert at your site. NOTE: Self enrollment is not allowed for this mail group.
3.  Prior to installing the patch, the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) needs to be examined for any ABBREVIATION entries that will conflict with the four new components exported with this patch. Each new national component along with its ABBREVIATION is listed here:

> NAME ABBREVIATION

> MAS CONTACTS CON

> MAS MH CLINIC VISITS FUTURE MHFV

> MH HIGH RISK PRF HX MHRF

> MH TREATMENT COORIDNATOR MHTC

> The "C" cross-reference for the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) contains the ABBREVIATION for each component. Examine the global listing for this cross-reference to determine if any local components will need the ABBREVATION field updated. If an ABBREVIATION conflict is found, the "Create/Modify Health Summary Components" option of the GMTS IRM MAINTENANCE MENU should be used to edit the local component's ABBREVIATION.

> The GMTS patch contains an installation routine (GMTSPI99) that will perform an environment check, do any necessary housekeeping, and then install the new Health Summary items. The environment check will examine the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) to ensure there will not be any NAME (.01) or NUMBER (.001) collisions with the four new nationally deployed Health Summary Components (MAS CONTACTS, MAS MH CLINIC VISITS FUTURE , MH HIGH RISK PRF HX , and MH TREATMENT COORDINATOR). If any possible collisions are found, the install will be aborted until the issue is resolved. After the issue has been addressed, local IT staff can re-install the patch.

> After the environment check, the PRE section of the routine will delete any previous versions of: the Reminder Exchange file used to deploy portions of the Health Summary items, the Health Summary Components, and the Health Summary Types (VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT and REMOTE HIGH RISK MH PATIENT). PRE will also re-index the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE and HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT files along with rebuilding the Ad Hoc Health Summary.

> After PRE, the POST section of the routine will create stub entries in file \#142 for the remote Health Summary Type, and then call the silent Reminder Exchange install utility to install the remaining Health Summary items. Lastly, POST will re-index the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE and HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT files along with rebuilding the Ad Hoc Health Summary.

4.  Check for local mappings of VA-MHV INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION (see pages 2 and 14 in this manual for more instructions).

## # Installation 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This manual describes how to install the combined build that includes builds DG\*5.3\*836, SD\*5.3\*578, GMTS\*2.7\*99, TIU\*1.0\*260, and PXRM\*2.0\*18.

This build can be installed with users on the system, but it should be done during non-peak hours.

*The installation needs to be done by a person with DUZ(0) set to "@."NOTE: DO NOT QUEUE THE INSTALLATION, because this installation asks questions requiring responses and queuing will stop the installation. A Reminders Manager or CAC should be present to respond to these.*NOTE: We recommend that a Clinical Reminders Manager or CAC be present during the install, so that if questions occur during the install of Reminder Exchange entries, a knowledgeable person can respond to them.

## Retrieve the host file containing the multi-package build, HIGH RISK MH 1.0. 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Use ftp to access the build (the name of the host file is HIGH_RISK_MH_1_0 .KID) from one of the following locations (with the ASCII file type):

> Albany ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov \<ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov\>

> Hines ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov \<ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov\>

> Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov \<ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov\>

## Install the build first in a training or test account. 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> Installing in a non-production environment will give you time to get familiar with new functionality and complete the setup for reminders and dialogs prior to installing the software in production.

## Load the distribution. 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In programmer mode type, D ^XUP, select the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu (XPD MAIN), then the Installation option, and then the option LOAD a Distribution. Enter your directory name and HIGH_RISK_MH_1.0.KID at the Host File prompt.

Example

> Select Installation Option: LOAD a Distribution

> Enter a Host File: \[DIR\] HIGH_RISK_MH_1.0.KID,where \[DIR\] is the local

> directory where you have stored the host file.

> Loading Distribution...

> HIGH RISK MH 1.0

> DG\*5.3\*836

> SD\*5.3\*578

> Build GMTS\*2.7\*99 has an Environmental Check Routine

> Want to RUN the Environment Check Routine? YES//

> GMTS\*2.7\*99

> Will first run the Environment Check Routine, GMTSPI99

> Verifying installation environment...

> Checking Health Summary Component file (#142.1)

> TIU\*1.0\*260

> PXRM\*2.0\*18

> Use INSTALL NAME: HIGH RISK MH 1.0 to install this Distribution.

From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following options:

## ## Backup a Transport Global 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> This option will create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT back up any other changes such as DDs or templates.

> INSTALL NAME: HIGH RISK MH 1.0

## Compare Transport Global to Current System

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> This option will allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).

## Verify Checksums in Transport Global 

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

> This option will allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global. If there are any discrepancies, do not run the Install Package(s) option. Instead, run the Unload a Distribution option to remove the Transport Global from your system. Retrieve the file again from the anonymous directory (in case there was corruption in FTPing) and Load the Distribution again. If the problem still exists, log a Remedy ticket and/or call the national Help Desk (1-888-596-HELP) to report the problem.

1. Enter names to mail group

> Enter the names of Suicide Prevention Coordinators and/or other MH professionals responsible for coordinating follow-up of High Risk for Suicide patients that miss a MH appointment. The mail group owner of the SD MH NO SHOW NOTIFICATION mail group (as entered during the installation process) will need to add these names after the multi-package build is installed. The mail group members added to this mail group will receive the new Scheduling report results (from the nightly background job) in a MailMan Message. This can include all facility SPCs if you’re an integrated site.

> Example:

> \>D ^XUP

> Setting up programmer environment

> This is a TEST account.

> Select Group/Distribution Management Option: Mail Group Coordinator's Edit \[XMMGR-MAIL-GRP-COORDINATOR\]

> This option allows a mail group coordinator to edit the mail groups that

> he or she is the coordinator of (and no others). It does not allow edit

> of remote recipients.

> Select MAIL GROUP NAME: SD MH NO SHOW NOTIFICATION

> Select MEMBER: MHUSER,TWO

> Are you adding 'MHUSER,TWO' as a new MEMBER (the 1ST for this MAIL GROUP)? No// YES

> Select MEMBER: MHUSER,THREE

2.  Assign report options

> Assign these report options to the primary or secondary menu options of your Suicide Prevention Coordinators, Mental Health Treatment Coordinator, and other Mental Health Professionals who will be tracking missed appointments for high risk for suicide patients:

- SD MH NO SHOW AD HOC REPORT
  - Scheduling Mental Health AD HOC NO SHOW Report           
- SD MH NO SHOW NIGHTLY BGJ
  - No Show Nightly Background Job   (tasked job)   
3.  Add the new health summary types to the CPRS Reports tab display 

> Follow your facility’s rules and conventions for adding these health summary types.

1.  VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT - This Type contains the four Health Summary Components mentioned above, and is the basis for creating the VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT (TIU) Health Summary Object.
2.  REMOTE MH HIGH RISK PATIENT - This Type contains the same components as the VA-MH HIGH RISK PATIENT and allows viewing the aforementioned information from remote sites.

> Sequencing new Health Summary types is done in the GUI Parameters option.

> Example

> Select CPRS Manager Menu Option: PE  CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)

> Select CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) Option: GP GUI Parameters

> Select GUI Parameters Option: HS  GUI Health Summary Types

> Allowable Health Summary Types may be set for the following:

>      2   User          USR    \[choose from NEW PERSON\]

>      3   Division      DIV    \[choose from INSTITUTION\]

>      4   System        SYS    \[TEST.FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV\]

>      5   Service       SVC    \[choose from SERVICE/SECTION\]

> Enter selection: 4  System   xxx.MED.VA.GOV

> \- Setting Allowable Health Summary Types  for System: PUGET-SOUND.MED.VA.GOV -

> Sequence: 20//

> Health Summary: VA-HIGH RISK MH PATIENT

> Sequence: 21//                (your sequence numbers will be different)

> Health Summary: REMOTE MH HIGH RISK PATIENT

4.  Assign the High Risk MH No-Show Follow-up reminder to users’ coversheets, following local policies.  
Edit Cover Sheet Reminder List Example

![](pxrm-2-18-high-risk-mental-health-patient-reminder-flag-installation-and-setup-g/002.png)

5.  If necessary, edit the Parameter Definition for the PRF FOR SUCIDE PREVENTION. If your site has a different name for this PRF, you’ll need to go into the Parameter Tools option (XPAR MENU TOOLS) to change this. NOTE: You may need programmer access to use this option.

> Select General Parameter Tools Option: EP Edit Parameter Values

> --- Edit Parameter Values ---

> Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME: PRF FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION DGPF SUICIDE FLAG

> PRF for Suicide Prevention

> ------------ Setting DGPF SUICIDE FLAG for Package: REGISTRATION ------------

> Value: HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE Replace

6.  Update the reminder term with the name of the local PRF flag, after setting up the DG SUICIDE PREVENTION parameter.

> ---- Begin: VA-MH HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE PRF (FI(2)=RT(811)) --------------

>                   Finding Type: REMINDER TERM

>    Use in Patient Cohort Logic: AND

>            Beginning Date/Time: FIEVAL(1,1,"DATE")

>               Ending Date/Time: FIEVAL(1,1,"DATE")+1D

>                     Mapped Findings: CF.VA-PATIENT RECORD FLAG         

>                                      INFORMATION                       

>          Computed Finding Parameter: HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE^L

>   ---- End: VA-MH HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE PRF --------------------------------

- Use the Reminder Term edit option (Reminder Manager’s Menu)
- Select the VA-MH HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE PRF reminder term
- Select the Finding CF.VA-PATIENT RECORD FLAG INFORMATION
- Add local PRF name to Computed Finding Parameter followed by “^L”.
- Example:         

>          Computed Finding Parameter: HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE^L

7.  If you are using \$P in a Condition, we recommend that you replace it with the appropriate CSUBs. Several national definitions and terms were originally distributed with Conditions using \$P; as part of this patch they will be updated to use the SYSTOLIC and DIASTOLIC CSUBs.

> SYSTOLIC/MEAN/DIASTOLIC and use of CSUB instead of \$P: The Clin4 support team pointed out that the value for blood pressure can come back in either of the following forms: SYSTOLIC/DIASTOLIC or SYSTOLIC/MEAN/DIASTOLIC ( the second form is not very common). If the second form comes back, then the DIASTOLIC CSUB would have the value for mean, and if \$P was used in a Condition, it would also be the mean. The code was changed so that the DIASTOLIC CSUB will always have the correct value.

8.  Add back locally mapped findings if they were removed. As stated in Pre-Installation instructions, the reminder term VA-MHV INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION was installed with the overwrite action, which means that all locally mapped findings were removed. Therefore, prior to the installation, you were advised to use the “Inquire about Reminder Term” option to check this term and verify that it was mapped with your local findings.  If there are no mapped local findings, then after this install, add proper local mappings to complete this reminder term’s definition After the installation, the term will have a single mapped finding which will look similar to this:

>                   Finding Item: INFLUENZA, HIGH DOSE SEASONAL, PRESERV-FREE 

>                                 (FI(1)=IM(612013))                           

>                   Finding Type: IMMUNIZATION

>            Beginning Date/Time: 8/20/10

> Use the saved term inquiry as a reference and add back the locally mapped findings that were removed.  Do not remove the mapped finding that was installed by the patch.

# Appendix B – Nightly Background Job and Ad Hoc Report Examples

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This is a sample of the High Risk Mental Health NO Show Nightly Report. This report is generated at the end of the Scheduling Nightly Background job, and will be sent in a Mailman message to those persons added to mail group SD MH NO SHOW NOTIFICATION. All persons in this mail group will receive the High Risk Mental Health NO SHOW report that is generated from the scheduling nightly background job. An option to manually run the no show background job if there was an error in running the report, has also been created called SD MH NO SHOW NIGHTLY BGJ (High Risk MH No-Show Nightly Report).

The Background job will list the patients who had a status of “NO-SHOW,” “NO SHOW WITH AUTO-REBOOK,” and “No Action Taken” for the day before that have the patient record flag ‘”High Risk for Mental Health.” It will list patients for all mental health clinics/stop codes that are defined in the Remote location list ‘VA-MH NO SHOW APPT CLINICS LL’. The VA-MH NO SHOW APPT CLINICS LL location list includes clinic stop codes for MH clinics that are scheduled for face-to-face appointments.

This report will list future scheduled appointments for 30 days in the future.

This is how the report will display to the screen when reading mailman.

High Risk MH No-Show Ad hoc Report

This option (SD MH NO SHOW AD HOC REPORT) will list by one, many or All stop codes or only Mental Health stop codes defined in the Reminder Location List file under the ‘VA-MH NO SHOW APPT CLINICS LL’ entry.

A series of prompts will be asked of the user to refine the report.

- The user will be asked to select a beginning and ending date: this will list the report within a certain date range.
- The division will be asked of the user: The report can list by one, many or all divisions.
- The user will then be asked to choose how the report should sort: by (M)ental Health Quick List, which will list only those clinics defined in the Reminder Location list, or by (C)linics or (S)top codes both of which will further prompt the user to refine the sort. If ?, ?? is entered by the user, a help prompt will be displayed.
- If the user selects to sort by (S)top codes, a prompt asking them to select stop codes by listing (A)ll stop codes, (mental health as well as non mental health) or (M)ental Health stop codes only (that are defined in the Reminder Location List) and are stop codes in the divison/s chosen to list in this report. Both selections will allow the user to choose one, many, or all stop codes.
- A prompt asking the number of days in the future to list the future scheduled appointment is asked and will list the future scheduled appointments that many days in the future.

When the report displays or prints:

- The division/Stop Code Name – Name/Number will display on the report once for all patients who have no showed for that Stop Code and division. It will display again, when the stop code or division changes.
- A total page will be displayed at the end of the report.

Special Note: At the Select Stop Code prompt, the stop code may be selected by the stop code file number (as example, selecting 188 below) or by the AMIS Reporting stop code (500 – 599 code numbers). An example of each is shown below.

<span class="mark">

Notice that when the user is prompted Select Stop codes: ALL//, if the user enters ??, the prompt displays all stop codes for mental health that are associated with the stop codes listed in the Reminder Location List VA-MH NO SHOW APPT CLINICS LL and non mental health stop codes to select (green highlight).

### Ad Hoc No Show Report by Mental Health Clinic

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This is a sample of the High Risk Mental Health NO Show Ad Hoc report, (option SD MH NO SHOW AD HOC REPORT, that will list by one, many, All clinics or only Mental Health clinics defined in the Reminder Location List file under the ‘VA-MH NO SHOW APPT CLINICS LL’ entry.

A series of prompts will be asked of the user to refine the report.

- The user will be asked to select a beginning and ending date: this will list the report within a certain date range.
- The division will be asked of the user: The report can list by one, many or all divisions.
- The user will then be asked to choose how the report should sort: by (M)ental Health Quick List, which will list only those clinics defined in the Reminder Location list, or by (C)linics or (S)top codes both of which will further prompt the user to refine the sort. If ?, ?? is entered by the user, a help prompt will be displayed.
- If the user selects to sort by clinic, a prompt asking them to select clinics by listing All clinics, (mental health as well as non mental health) or Mental Health clinics only (that are defined in the Reminder Location List) and are clinics in the divisions chosen to list in this report. Both selections will allow the user to choose one, many, or all clinics.
- A prompt asking the number of days in the future to list the future scheduled appointment is asked and will list the future scheduled appointments that many days in the future.

When the report displays or prints:

- The division/Clinic name will display on the report once for all patients who have no showed for that clinic and division. It will display again, when the clinic or division changes.
- A totals page will be displayed at the end of the report.

### Ad Hoc No Show Report for All Clinics

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This is an example of how the No Show displays for All clinics. Notice when the user selects (C)linics as the sort, the user is asked to select (A)ll or (M)ental Health clinics only. If the user selects (A)ll and enters ?? at the list prompt, all mental health as well as non-mental health clinics can be selected, or if the user hits return, all clinics will be selected and will display on the report.
