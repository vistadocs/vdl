Description:

============

OVERVIEW

The VISTA STATE file (#5) and the Austin Automation Center's (AAC) edit

table are not fully synchronized. This problem is causing VISTA reporting

mechanisms to fail.

Most recently, Outpatient Workload reporting for Ambulatory Care has in

some cases NOT been passing the standard edit checks, both locally at the

sites and at Austin. The VISTA STATE file and the AAC edit table MUST be

synchronized to enable sites to receive their workload credit.

This is an informational patch providing instructions for synchronizing

the VISTA STATE file (#5) and the AAC edit table. These recommended

modifications will standardize State and County entries across all

Veterans Affairs Medical Centers and with the Austin Automation Center.

Following the general instructions, below, you will find step-by-step

instructions (with examples) for making the changes to the VISTA STATE

file.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

1\) Use the VA FileMan option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to make all recommended modifications to the VISTA STATE file (#5).

2\) Should you require additional help using VA FileMan, see the VA FileMan User Manual, Version 21.0, Chapter 4 - How to Enter or Change Data.

3\) The following Immunology Case Registry security keys should be temporarily assigned to the IRM personnel responsible for making these modifications to the VISTA STATE file:

> 1\. IMRMGR

> 2\. IMRA

These keys are necessary to update pointers in the ICR SITE PARAMETERS file (#158.9).

4\) Sample screen captures are provided to help illustrate recommended procedures.

5\) You must be in programmer mode to make these modifications.

6\) All entries to the VISTA STATE file must be made in UPPER CASE and typed exactly as shown.

7\) The Return or Enter key is illustrated by the symbol \<ret\>. It is displayed in screen captures of computer dialogue when this keystroke must be entered.

8\) It is understood that the repointing of FileMan entries may take some time based on the number of entries involved. In fact, it may take all night to complete just one step depending on the number of repointed entries, and it may take several nights to complete all of the parts of this patch. The steps have been made to run sequentially but do not have to be run all at one time.

YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EDIT YOUR LOCAL VISTA STATE FILE:

PART 1:

Assign yourself the IMRMGR and IMRA Security Keys.

PART 2:

Use the VA FileMan option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to correct the following errors in the VISTA STATE file. (Be advised that some or all of these entries may not be in your local VISTA STATE file. If you do not have any one particular entry in your STATE file, do nothing. Skip to the next instructions.)

1) EDIT STATE FILE ENTRY: FOREIGN COUNTRY

If you currently have FOREIGN COUNTRY as a State entry in

your STATE file, follow these instructions otherwise go on

to Step 2.

> a\. Using the FileMan "Enter or Edit File Entries" option delete the State entry FOREIGN COUNTRY and update all pointers by re-pointing to the State entry OTHER.

> b\. Exit option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to allow the pointers to automatically update.

> NOTE: VA FileMan automatically generates a report displaying file entries in which, pointers have been changed. You can send this report to a local printer or to your terminal screen. This automatic report generation will take a few minutes.

THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES HOW TO DO THIS:

> --------------------------------------------------------------------

> D P^DI \<ret\>

> VA FileMan 21.0

> Select OPTION: 1 \<ret\> ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

> INPUT TO WHAT FILE: STATE// \<ret\> (80 entries)

> SINCE THE DELETED ENTRY MAY HAVE BEEN 'POINTED TO'

> BY ENTRIES IN THE 'PATIENT' FILE, ETC.,

> DO YOU WANT THOSE POINTERS UPDATED (WHICH COULD TAKE

> QUITE A WHILE)? No// Y \<ret\> (Yes)

> WHICH DO YOU WANT TO DO? --

> b\. Change the State ABBREVIATION entry from XX to FG.

> c\. Change the VA STATE CODE from 98 to 90.

> d\. Add one County sub-entry ALL OTHER FOREIGN with a VA COUNTY CODE of 999.

THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES HOW TO DO THIS:

3) EDIT STATE FILE ENTRY: CANAL ZONE

> a\. Using the FileMan "Enter or Edit File Entries" option delete the State entry CANAL ZONE and update the pointers by re-pointing to the State entry FOREIGN COUNTRY.

THIS PROCEDURE IS SIMILIAR TO STEP 1. NO EXAMPLE CAPTURE

INCLUDED FOR THIS ONE.

4) EDIT STATE FILE ENTRY: QUEBEC

> If you do not currently have QUEBEC as a State entry, do nothing. Skip to the next step. (You will be adding the Canadian Province of QUEBEC later in these instructions.)

> b\. Enter an ABBREVIATION of QC.

> c\. Enter a VA STATE CODE of 80.

> d\. Delete the current State entry QUEBEC and update all pointers by re-pointing to the "placeholder" State entry QUEBEC\*\*.

> e\. Exit option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to allow the pointers to automatically update. \[For more information see the advisory NOTE in STEP 1, line item 1).\]
