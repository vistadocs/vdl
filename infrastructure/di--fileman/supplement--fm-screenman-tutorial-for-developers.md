How to Use this Manual

The *VA FileMan ScreenMan Tutorial for Developers* is intended to help VistA developers create ScreenMan forms using VA FileMan’s Form Editor. The Form Editor provides a major improvement in the speed and ease of creating ScreenMan forms. The tutorial emphasizes the use of the Form Editor in creating forms.

HTML Manuals

Why produce an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) edition of the *VA FileMan ScreenMan Tutorial for Developers*?

- The HTML versions of the VA FileMan manuals are useful as online documentation support as you use VA FileMan. HTML manuals allow you to instantly jump (link) to specific sections or references online.
- The VA FileMan HTML manuals are “living” documents that are continuously updated with the most current VA FileMan information (unlike paper or printed documentation). They are updated based on new versions, patches, or enhancements to VA FileMan.
- Presenting manuals in an HTML format on a Web server also gives new opportunities, such as accessing embedded multimedia training material (e.g., movies) directly in the manuals themselves.
- Manuals are accessible over the VA Intranet network.

Intended Audience

The intended audience of this tutorial is all key stakeholders. The stakeholders include:

- Office of Information and Technology (OI&T)—VistA legacy development teams.
- Information Resource Management (IRM)—System administrators at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sites who are responsible for computer management and system security on the VistA M Servers.
- Health Product Support (HPS).

Legal Requirements

There are no special legal requirements involved in the use of VA FileMan.

Disclaimers

This manual provides an overall explanation of VA FileMan ScreenMan functionality contained in VA FileMan 22.0; however, no attempt is made to explain how the overall VistA programming system is integrated and maintained. Such methods and procedures are documented elsewhere. We suggest you look at the various VA Internet and Intranet websites for a general orientation to VistA. For example, visit the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) VistA Development Intranet website.

<span id="_Ref386466666" class="anchor"></span>Table . Documentation symbol descriptions

- Descriptive text is presented in a proportional font (as represented by this font).
- Conventions for displaying TEST data in this document are as follows:
- The first three digits (prefix) of any Social Security Numbers (SSN) begin with either “000” or “666”.
- Patient and user names are formatted as follows: \[Application Name\]PATIENT,\[N\] and \[Application Name\]USER,\[N\] respectively, where “Application Name” is defined in the Approved Application Abbreviations document and “N” represents the first name as a number spelled out and incremented with each new entry. For example, in VA FileMan (FM) test patient and user names would be documented as follows: FMPATIENT,ONE; FMPATIENT,TWO; FMPATIENT,THREE; etc.
- Sample HL7 messages, “snapshots” of computer online displays (i.e., roll-and-scroll screen or character-based screen captures/dialogues) and computer source code, if any, are shown in a *non*-proportional font and enclosed within a box.
- User’s responses to online prompts are bold typeface and highlighted in yellow (e.g., <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>).
- Emphasis within a dialogue box is bold typeface and highlighted in blue (e.g.,<span class="mark"> STANDARD LISTENER: RUNNING</span>).
- Some software code reserved/key words are bold typeface with alternate color font.
- References to “\<Enter\>“ within these snapshots indicate that the user should press the Enter key on the keyboard. Other special keys are represented within \< \> angle brackets. For example, pressing the PF1 key can be represented as pressing \<PF1\>.
- Author’s comments are displayed in italics or as “callout” boxes.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/007.png) NOTE: Callout boxes refer to labels or descriptions usually enclosed within a box, which point to specific areas of a displayed image.

- All uppercase is reserved for the representation of M code, variable names, or the formal name of options, field/file names, and security keys (e.g., DIEXTRACT).

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/008.png) NOTE: Other software code (e.g., Delphi/Pascal and Java) variable names and file/folder names can be written in lower or mixed case.

## Objectives

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

After completing this tutorial, you should have the skills to create a ScreenMan interface to VA FileMan files. You will be able to:

- Create a ScreenMan Form.
- Add read-only fields to the form.
- Add editable fields to the form.
- Use the form editor to visually position fields on blocks.
- Add additional pages to the form.
- Edit multiples on the form (two methods).
- Add ScreenMan computed fields and form-only fields to the form.
- Edit fields in another file’s related entries.
- Use branching logic to jump from one field to another.
- Turn the ScreenMan form into a Menu Manager option.

## Files Used

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This tutorial needs the following files to be present in your test account:

- NEW PERSON (#200)—Primary file; you add a ScreenMan form to it.
- OPTION (#19)—Form navigates to edit fields in this file.
- SERVICE/SECTION (#49)—Form navigates to edit fields in this file.

## Advance Preparation

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This is a hands-on tutorial, requiring a safe (i.e., *non*-production) M account in which you can build a ScreenMan form.

The following software *must* be installed in the test account you use for the tutorial:

- VA FileMan 22.0
- Kernel 8.0

This tutorial needs the following files to be present in your test account:

- NEW PERSON (#200)—Primary file used by the tutorial; you add a ScreenMan form to it.
- OPTION (#19)—ScreenMan form navigates to edit fields in this file.
- SERVICE/SECTION (#49)—ScreenMan form navigates to edit fields in this file.

Kernel provides access to the ScreenMan options, as well as providing the files for which you build a ScreenMan form during the tutorial.

You need to be granted the following privileges in the M test account used for the tutorial:

- The XUSCREENMAN security key.
- A File Manager Access code of at-sign (“@”).

It is further assumed that you have full, unrestricted programmer access in this test account, including the ability to run any option and to add options to your menu tree without supervision.

Each tutorial user should choose a unique namespace beginning with Z, concatenated with two or three other letters (e.g., Z*YXU*). Use this namespace as the beginning of the names for all forms and blocks that you create during this tutorial. Using your namespace protects the system you are using from having existing forms and blocks overwritten. This namespace is referred to as Z*xxx* during the tutorial.

# Starting Out with Forms

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This section of the tutorial shows you how to start building a form. It demonstrates:

- Initial building of a form.
- How to add blocks to a form.
- How to add simple fields to a block.

In this section of the tutorial, you will do the following:

- <u>Create a Form</u>.
- <u>Add a DISPLAY Block to the Form</u>.
- <u>Add a Title (Caption-Only Field)</u>.
- <u>Reposition Fields on a Block</u>.
- <u>Add Data Dictionary Fields</u>.
- <u>Run the Form</u>.
- <u>Add an Edit Block to the Form</u>.
- <u>Add Data Dictionary Fields to the EDIT Block</u>.
- <u>Use PRINT^DDS to List Form Characteristics</u>.

## Create a Form

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

ScreenMan is a tool for screen-oriented, form-oriented data entry into VA FileMan files. The Form Editor tool was introduced with VA FileMan 21.0. It assists developers in creating ScreenMan interfaces. This tutorial concentrates on creating forms with the Form Editor.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Create a form to edit entries in the NEW PERSON file (#200).

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/017.png) NOTE: You will *not* edit every field in the NEW PERSON file (#200), because that could be a big form!

- Add selected fields from the NEW PERSON file (#200) to the form, in such a way that you get experience using a variety of the features ScreenMan.
- At the end of the tutorial, you will have built a form that is very similar to Kernel’s Edit User Characteristics option (although your form edits a different set of fields).

#### ScreenMan Forms

When you create a form, a first page is created for the form by default. You *cannot* place fields directly on either a form or page; you *must* create blocks first. This is because the only place fields can be placed on is a block. A block provides a place to logically group a set of fields; you might edit a Multiple’s fields in one block on one page, and the top-level fields for the file on a block on another page. You can also designate whether the fields on any given block are display-only or editable.

<u>Figure 1</u> shows the relationships with blocks, pages, and forms:

<span id="_Ref390176444" class="anchor"></span>Figure . Relationships with blocks, pages, and forms

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/018.png)

Thus, to create a form, the first step is to create the form itself. The first page of the form is created automatically when the form is created. However, before you can add fields to the form, you *must* add at least one block to the form. Adding a block to the form you create will be your second step.

#### Form Editor

The most basic element in a ScreenMan form is the form itself. To create the form, you use a tool called the Form Editor. You can invoke the Form Editor from the following:

- <u>Using the Edit/Create a Form Option</u> \[DDS EDIT/CREATE A FORM\]
- <u>Using the Direct Mode Utility</u>

#### Using the Edit/Create a Form Option

From the VA FileMan main menu \[DIUSER\], do the following:

1.  At the “Select VA FileMan Option:” prompt, select Other Options menu \[DIOTHER\].
2.  At the “Select Other Options Option:” prompt, select the ScreenMan main menu \[DDS SCREEN MENU\].

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/019.png) NOTE: This option is locked with the XUSCREENMAN security key.

3.  At the “Select ScreenMan Option:” prompt, select the Edit/Create a Form option \[DDS EDIT/CREATE A FORM\].

1.  Invoke the Form Editor, using either the menu option (see <u>Figure 2</u>) or the direct-mode utility (see Section <u>2.1.1.2.2</u>).
2.  The first thing you are asked is for what file to create a form. Since you are creating a form to edit the NEW PERSON file (#200), enter NEW PERSON.
3.  You are now asked for a form name. Entering two question marks (“??”) lists current forms defined for the NEW PERSON file (#200). Enter a new unique form name using your student namespace concatenated with “ EDIT”. For example, if your namespace is Z*YXU*, add a form called Z*YXU* EDIT.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/020.png) NOTE: From hereon in, the namespace part of a name is referred to as “Z*xxx*” in the tutorial.

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this lesson you learned how to create a ScreenMan form using the Form Editor.

The Form Editor can be invoked with the Edit/Create a Form option, and also with the direct-mode utility: D ^DDGF.

## Add a DISPLAY Block to the Form

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The form you created in Section <u>2.1</u> has a page (page 1 is created by default), but no blocks yet. In order to add any fields to the form, you need to place a block on the form. Thus, the first thing to do with your form is to add a block.

There are two types of blocks:

- EDIT—Allows fields to be changed by the user.
- DISPLAY—Allows fields to be displayed but *not* changed by the user.

The cursor position, at the time you add a block, defines the region of the block. The region of the page covered by the block starts at the cursor position, and moves down and to the right. Thus, if the block covers only the bottom half of the page, you are only able to place fields on the bottom-half of that page (for that block only).

You can add more than one block on a page. The following are some reasons why you might use more than one block on a page:

- Reusing Blocks—You have a multi-page form, for example, and want the same header information on each page of the form. You can create a block for the header information only, and reuse the same block on each page of the form. Each page would then need an additional block for the fields unique to each page.
- Separate Blocks—If fields on the same page come from different data dictionary file numbers (either from a Multiple, or from another file), you need to use separate blocks. You can only place fields from a single data dictionary file number on any given block.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/023.png) NOTE: Both of these situations are covered in subsequent sections in this tutorial.

- Display-only Blocks—You can make a field on an EDIT block “display-only” by individually setting that field’s DISABLE EDITING property. You can have a large number of display-only fields, as well as some fields to edit, however. In this case, it can be easier to place the display-only fields on their own DISPLAY block, rather than set each field’s DISABLE EDITING property.

### Procedure

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this section, you will add a single block to the page, and make it a DISPLAY block.

To add a DISPLAY block, do the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, with your Z*xxx* EDIT form loaded, use the arrow keys to position the cursor at row 1, column 1 if it is *not* already at that position. This is the top-left corner on the form.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/024.png) TIP: Cursor Position:  
  
The current cursor position is always displayed at the lower-right corner of the Form Editor screen.

2.  At the current cursor position (row 1, column 1), press \<PF2\>B to add a block to the form at the cursor.
3.  When asked to select a new block name, enter your namespace concatenated with “MAIN 1” (e.g., ”Z*xxx* MAIN 1”):

## Reposition Fields on a Block

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In Section <u>2.3</u>, you added a caption field to the first block. Now, use the Form Editor’s visual editing capabilities to reposition the caption field on the block.

To reposition the caption field on the block, do the following:

1.  Select the field.
2.  Move it.
3.  De-select the field.

### Procedure

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To reposition fields on a block, do the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the first letter in the *caption*<span class="mark">N</span>EW PERSON EDIT.

Press Spacebar *or*Enter with the cursor in the field caption to select the field; this highlights the entire field.

Move the field:

1.  With the field highlighted, move it by pressing the arrow keys.
7.  Move the field to the center of row 1.  
      
    The leftmost character of the field should be at row 1, column 32; you can tell by the R1,C32 indicator in the lower-right corner of the window: as shown in <u>Figure 11</u>:

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/027.png) TIP: Moving Screen Elements:  
  
There are other shortcut keystrokes that you can use when moving screen elements (e.g., fields). These keystrokes (move field to top of screen, move field to bottom of screen, etc.) are described in the “ScreenMan” section in the VA FileMan User Manual.

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Form Editor provides visual field positioning capabilities. This lets you quickly position fields on blocks, which helps you build visually attractive forms very quickly.

## Add Data Dictionary Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

At this point, you have added one field, a caption-only field, to the first block. Now, you will add the following data dictionary fields to the DISPLAY-only block from the NEW PERSON file (#200):

- NAME
- SSN

Because these fields are placed on a DISPLAY-only block, the values are displayed to the form user, but are *not* editable.

### Procedure

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Adding Name Field

To add the NAME field, do the following:

1.  Position the cursor at the beginning of the third line on the screen, using the arrow keys:
1.  Press \<PF2\>F to add a field to the block.
2.  Set the field up as shown in <u>Figure 12</u>:

If you need to, you can re-position the fields in the same way that you re-positioned the “NEW PERSON EDIT” caption in Section <u>2.4.2</u>.

#### Reposition Fields

To reposition fields, do the following:

1.  Select a field:
1.  Move the cursor to the field caption.
2.  Press Spacebar *or*Enter.

Use the arrow keys to move the field.

Press Enter to drop the field in its new location.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/028.png) TIP: Positioning Data Dictionary Fields: Caption Portion and Data Field Portion:  
  
Data dictionary fields have two parts, caption and data field, which can be positioned independently. If you position the cursor under the caption of a data dictionary field and press Spacebar or Enter, you select the caption and data field parts together. However, if you position the cursor under the data field (the underlined portion) and then select, you select the data field only, and can position it independently of the field caption. In this tutorial, you should always move the caption and data field together.

#### Deleting Fields

To delete a field, do the following:

1.  Select a field:
1.  Move the cursor to the field caption.
3.  Press Spacebar *or*Enter.

Press PF4 to edit the properties of the element.

At the “Field Order:” prompt, enter an at-sign (“@”).

At the “Are you sure you want to delete this entire Subrecord (Y/N)?” prompt, enter YES.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/029.png) CAUTION: Deletions are done *immediately*! Exiting *without* saving will *not* restore deleted records.

## Add Data Dictionary Fields to the EDIT Block

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In Section <u>2.7</u>, you added an EDIT-type block to the form. Now, you can add some data dictionary fields to the EDIT block. This means that the user is actually able to edit data in the NEW PERSON file (#200) when they use the form.

In this section, you will add the following fields to the edit block (Z*xxx* MAIN 2), in the order listed below:

1.  PHONE (HOME)

PHONE \#3

PHONE \#4

OFFICE PHONE

AUTO MENU

INITIAL

NICK NAME

PREFERRED EDITOR

TYPE-AHEAD

### Procedure

#### Add Fields

To add each field, do the following:

1.  Position the cursor somewhere on the Z*xxx* MAIN 2 block, which is anywhere from row 5 to the bottom of the form; roughly where you would like to place the field.

Press \<PF2\>F to add the individual field.

When the Form Editor asks for block, make sure you choose Z*xxx* MAIN 2:

1.  Accept the default FIELD ORDER.
2.  Make sure the FIELD TYPE is DATA DICTIONARY FIELD, as shown in <u>Figure 20</u>.

\| \|

\| Select BLOCK: Z*xxx* MAIN 2 \|

\| FIELD ORDER: 1 \|

\| FIELD TYPE: DATA DICTIONARY FIELD \|

\| \|

----------------------------------------------

Press \<PF1\>E to save and exit this dialogue.

When you reach the “Data Dictionary Field Properties” dialogue:

1.  Choose the appropriate field by entering the field name in the FIELD property. Enter one of the following fields (in the order listed):
- PHONE (HOME)
- PHONE \#3
- PHONE \#4
- OFFICE PHONE
- AUTO MENU
- INITIAL
- NICK NAME
- PREFERRED EDITOR
- TYPE-AHEAD
2.  Press \<PF1\>E to save the new field.
3.  Repeat Steps 1 through 5b for each of the fields listed in Step 5a.

After you have added each of the fields to the block, arrange the fields so that their captions are all right-aligned (i.e., colons terminating each caption should be in a vertical line). Use the Form Editor’s visual capabilities to do this:

1.  As you did before with the NEW PERSON EDIT caption, select each field:
1.  Place the cursor over the first letter of the field caption.
2.  Press Spacebar or Enter. This selects (highlights) the field.
2.  Use the arrow keys to move the field.
3.  Press Spacebar *or*Enter again to drop the field into place and deselect the field.

By default, the “edit order” of the fields on the form is the same order in which you add fields to the form. You can change the field order on the block at a later time, however.

Press \<PF1\>E to exit the Form Editor.

Choose the Run a Form option to run and test the form. The form should now look like <u>Figure 21</u> (with sample data):

1.  Test the field order. Starting at the initial field that ScreenMan places you in, press Enter at each field; you should move to the next field down on the form, until you traverse all fields and are placed at the COMMAND prompt.
2.  If the field order is *not* correct, however, you can return to the Form Editor and change the field order for any field.

#### Change Field Order

To change the field order for any field, do the following:

1.  Select the field whose order you want to change:
1.  Move the cursor to the field caption.
2.  Press Spacebar *or*Enter to select the field.

Press PF4 to edit the field properties.

Change the field order to a different number (decimal fractions are allowed).

#### Reset Field Order

Alternatively, you can reset the field order of *all* fields to be left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

To reset the field order of all fields to left-to-right, top-to-bottom, do the following:

1.  From the Form Editor, go to the Block Viewer screen by pressing \<PF1\>V.

Select the block in question:

1.  Move cursor to it.
2.  Press Spacebar *or*Enter to select the block.

Press \<PF1\>O to reorder the field sequence.

Press Spacebar *or*Enter again to de-select the block.

Press \<PF1\>V to return to the normal Form Editor screen.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/032.png) TIP: Display Width vs. Actual Width for Fields:  
  
Some fields are longer than a form is wide; fields can be up to 245 characters in length. How can you edit a field like this in a ScreenMan form, which is only 80 characters wide? The answer is that when you place a field like this on a form, you can set the field’s display width by setting its DATA LENGTH property. You could set its DATA LENGTH to be 75, for example. Then, when the user runs the form, the field is displayed in a 75-character-wide window. To see and edit the entire field, the user can press \<PF1\>Z; this opens a large edit area at the bottom of the screen.  
  
You can use this technique even with fields that fit within the width of your form. For example, you might have a field that is 60 characters in length, but set it so that it only takes up 30 characters when displayed on your form (by setting its DATA LENGTH to 30).

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/033.png) CONGRATULATIONS: Making an interface to edit fields in the NEW PERSON file (#200) was as easy as that!

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To let users edit data in a VA FileMan file, you can add data dictionary fields to an Edit-type block on the form. The field order (when the user traverses fields by pressing Enter) is, by default, the order you add fields to the form. You can change the field order at a later time, if necessary.

## Use PRINT^DDS to List Form Characteristics

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

At this point, you have added several blocks and a number of fields to the form.

When you are working with forms, you can generate a report on your form so that you can review your form’s characteristics. ScreenMan provides a way to do this using the following direct-mode utility:

D PRINT^DDS

This lists all characteristics of a form. It lists the properties of the form itself and all properties of the blocks and fields used on the form.

### Procedure

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To generate a report on your form so that you can review your form’s characteristics, do the following:

1.  From the M programmer prompt, run PRINT^DDS.

Compare the output for your form to the output listed below. The printout for your form thus far should correspond to the printout listed in <u>Figure 22</u>:

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/034.png) CONGRATULATIONS: This is the end of the first section of the hands-on tutorial! You have:

- Created a ScreenMan form.
- Linked it to a file.
- Added both display-only and editable fields to the form.

If you want to try out some of the more advanced features of ScreenMan, continue on to the next section of this tutorial!

# Pages, Multiples, and Computed Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/035.png) NOTE: This section continues to build on the form you designed in Section <u>2</u>.

This section demonstrates some of the more typical things a developer might want to do with a form, beyond the adding of simple fields to a single page. It shows how to add pages to a form, and shows two ways of editing Multiple fields on a form. Also, it shows how to enhance the presentation of information with ScreenMan computed fields. You will do the following:

- Add a second page to your form.
- Edit a Multiple field using a repeating block.
- Edit a Multiple field using a popup page.
- Resize and reposition the popup page.
- Add a ScreenMan computed field, enhancing the presentation of the Multiple in the repeating block.

## Add a Page to a Form

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Forms can have more than one page. They can have many pages, each page with its own blocks. Some reasons to use more than one page in a form are:

- There are too many fields to fit on one page.
- You want to edit fields in a different file or in a Multiple.
- You want to display information in a “popup” page.

### Procedures

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Add a Page to a Form

To add a page to a form, do the following:

1.  Invoke the Form Editor, using either the menu option (see <u>Figure 2</u>) or the direct-mode utility (see Section <u>2.1.1.2.2</u>).

The first thing you are asked is for what file to create a form. Since we are creating a form to edit the NEW PERSON file (#200), enter NEW PERSON.

You are now asked for a form name. Entering two question marks lists current forms defined for the NEW PERSON file (#200). For this section, continue editing the form you created in Section <u>2</u>.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/036.png) NOTE: From hereon in, the namespace part of a name is referred to as “Z*xxx*” in the tutorial.

Once you select a name for the form, you are placed in the ScreenMan’s Form Editor.

Press \<PF2\>P to add a page.

Choose a unique page number for the page.

In the new page’s properties, fill in a page number for both the NEXT PAGE and PREVIOUS PAGE properties. This tells ScreenMan what pages to go to when the user moves backwards or forwards from the page.

Adjust the PREVIOUS PAGE and NEXT PAGE properties of other pages to make sure that the total sequence of pages is adjusted to include the new page.

Add a block to the new page. Every page should have at least one block.

#### Add a Second Page to a Form

To add a second page to a form, do the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, load the Z*xxx* EDIT USER form.
2.  Press \<PF2\>P to add a page.
3.  In a popup window, you are asked for the NEW PAGE NUMBER. In general, you should number the pages in your form sequentially, so it is easy to keep track of them. Since this is the second page in the form, enter 2.
4.  At the “Are you adding Page 2 as a new page on this form?” prompt, enter YES.
5.  The Form Editor presents a “Page Properties” dialogue letting you edit the characteristics of the new page.
1.  Enter 1 for the NEXT PAGE and PREVIOUS PAGE properties.
2.  Accept the defaults for all other properties.

The page properties should match those in <u>Figure 24</u>:

6.  Press \<PF1\>E to save the new page.
7.  The Form Editor now displays the blank second page of the form.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/037.png) NOTE: Next, you will need to add a block to the page.

#### Add an Edit Block

The new page needs at least one block.

To add an edit-type block to the page, do the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, on Page 2, position the cursor at row 1, column 1 (top-left corner).

Press \<PF2\>B to add a block to the form at the cursor position (row 1, column 1).

When asked to select a new block name, enter your namespace concatenated with “ MAIN 3” (e.g., ”Z*xxx* MAIN 3”).

At the “Are you adding ‘Z*xxx* MAIN 3’ as a new BLOCK? No//” prompt, enter YES.

At the “Are you adding ‘Z*xxx* MAIN 3’ as a new block on this page?” prompt, enter YES.

You are now given a chance to enter the properties for the Z*xxx* MAIN 3 block.

Verify the following entries:

- BLOCK ORDER should be 1.
- TYPE OF BLOCK should be EDIT.
- Accept the other defaults.

The block properties should match those shown in <u>Figure 25</u>:

For other shortcuts besides \<PF1\>P for navigating from one page to another, see the “ScreenMan” section in the VA FileMan User Manual.

#### Link Pages

Link the first page to the second by moving back to the first page and setting the first page’s NEXT PAGE property to 2.

To link the first page to the second, do the following:

1.  Press \<PF1\>P to change pages, and enter 1 as the “change to” page.

Once Page 1 is the current page, enter \<PF4\>P to edit the Page 1 properties.

For the NEXT PAGE and PREVIOUS PAGE properties, enter 2 (see <u>Figure 26</u>).

Press \<PF1\>E to save the properties for Page 1.

Once you are back in the Form Editor, press \<PF1\>E to save the form and exit.

Run and test the form using the Run a Form option:

1.  You should have a new choice, Next Page, from Page 1 at the COMMAND prompt.
10. Choosing Next Page at the COMMAND prompt should move you to the (currently blank) second page of the form.
11. Pressing \<PF1\>\<ARROWDOWN\> should move you to the next page.
12. Pressing \<PF1\>\<ARROWUP\> should move you to the previous page.

As a final touch, you can add two CAPTION fields at the top-right corners of the two pages:

- “Page 1 of 2” on the first page.
- “Page 2 of 2” on the second page.

## Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Forms can have multiple pages. When you add pages, your main task is to make sure that your pages all have appropriate PREVIOUS PAGE and NEXT PAGE links, so that a correct sequence of pages is available to users of your form.

## Add a Multiple Field (in a Repeating Block)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can provide users with the ability to edit data that is in a Multiple. The two common ways to edit Multiples on forms are:

- Add a repeating block that is dedicated to the Multiple.
- Add a popup page that is dedicated to the Multiple.

In this section, you will let the user edit data in a Multiple using a repeating block. You will add the ability on the form to edit the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS Multiple in the NEW PERSON file (#200).

A repeating block presents multiple entries in a scrolling list, making it possible to display more than one entry from the Multiple to the user at the same time. The main limitation to using a repeating block is that *all* fields to be edited *must* fit on one line on the screen.

The general process to set up a Multiple in a repeating block is:

1.  Add a new block (of type EDIT) to a page.

In the new block’s OTHER PARAMETERS section, set the REPLICATION property to the length of the list to in which to display Multiple entries.

Set the DD NUMBER property of the new block to the DD number of the Multiple.

Add the fields to edit in the Multiple (all in one line) to the repeating block (remove all captions).

If you want to add column “heading” captions above the row of fields, you can do so, but add the captions to a different block (*not* the repeating block). The only fields that should be on the repeating block should be one line of data fields.

In this section, you will add a repeating block to Page 2 of the form to edit the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS Multiple in the NEW PERSON file (#200).

### Procedures

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Add Repeating Block

To add a repeating block, do the following:

1.  Position the cursor on the Page 2 of the form, at row 5, column 7.

Press \<PF2\>B to add a new block to the current page.

For block name, enter Z*xxx* REPEATING 1.

At the “Are you adding ‘Z*xxx* REPEATING 1’ as a new BLOCK? No//” prompt, enter YES.

At the “Are you adding Z*xxx* REPEATING 1 as a new block on this page?” prompt, enter YES.

Enter the following data:

1.  BLOCK ORDER should be 2.
2.  TYPE OF BLOCK should be EDIT.

At the “OTHER PARAMETERS…” prompt, press Enter.

In the “Other Block Parameter” dialogue, do the following:

1.  Set REPLICATION to be 4. This makes the block a repeating block and sets the number of entries to display on screen to 4.

#### Add the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS .01 Field

Add the fields to the repeating block that you want users to be able to edit. Remember, you can only add fields that fit on one line to a repeating block. You will add two fields on one line:

- .01 field
- SYNONYM field

To add the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS .01 field to the repeating block, do the following:

1.  Position the cursor on Page 2 of the form, at row 5, column 7.

Press \<PF2\>F to add a field at the cursor position.

Add the field to the Z*xxx* REPEATING 1 block, with a field type of DATA DICTIONARY FIELD.

#### Add Caption-only Field Columnar Headings to the Repeating Block

Finally, add four caption-only fields just above the repeating block to provide neat columnar headings for the repeating block fields below.

To add caption-only field columnar headings to the repeating block, do the following:

1.  On Page 2, position the cursor at row 3, column 7:
1.  Add a caption-only field to the Z*xxx* MAIN 3 block (*not* the repeating block!); see Section <u>2.3</u> for instructions.
2.  Make sure you set the FIELD TYPE to CAPTION ONLY:

> <span id="_Toc395709611" class="anchor"></span>Figure . Adding a CAPTION ONLY field—Sample user dialogue

\| \|

\| Select BLOCK: <span class="mark">Z*xxx* MAIN 3</span> \|

\| FIELD ORDER: 2 \|

\| FIELD TYPE: <span class="mark">CAPTION ONLY</span> \|

\| \|

----------------------------------------------

13. Press \<PF1\>E to save the changes.

In the “Caption-Only Field Properties” dialogue:

1.  Set the CAPTION to “Secondary Menu Option”.
2.  Press \<PF1\>E to save the changes.

Position the cursor at row 3, column 40:

1.  Add a caption-only field to the Z*xxx* MAIN 3 block.
2.  Set the CAPTION to “Synonym”.

Position the cursor at row 4, column 7:

1.  Add a caption-only field to the Z*xxx* MAIN 3 block.
2.  At the CAPTION property, enter:

!DUP(“-”,30)

This is a shortcut way of making a caption of 30 hyphens.

Position the cursor at row 4, column 40:

1.  Add a caption-only field to the Z*xxx* MAIN 3 block.
2.  Set the CAPTION to “-------”.

If you do *not* get the captions to line up exactly:

1.  Select the caption-only field in question.
2.  Move cursor to the field and press Spacebar *or*Enter to select the field.
3.  Use the arrow keys to position the caption.
4.  Press Spacebar *or*Enter again to de-select the field.

Press \<PF1\>E to exit the Form Editor.

Run and test the form:

1.  Press \<PF1\>\<ARROW DOWN\>, \<NEXT SCREEN\>, or \<PAGE DOWN\> to go to Page 2.
14. There are four display lines for the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS Multiple. Below the last item in the list, try entering some options. For example:
- XU FINDUSER
- XU EPCS UTILITY FUNCTIONS
15. You can scroll up and down the list. Enter more than four options in the Multiple, so that you can see how the scrolling works.

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use a repeating block to edit Multiples:

- Advantage—You can present a list of entries from a Multiple on your form.
- Disadvantage—All the fields from the Multiple that you want to display or edit *must* fit on a single line.

## Add a Multiple Field (in a Popup Page)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Overview

In Section <u>3.3</u>, you used a repeating block to let the user edit *one* line’s worth of fields from a Multiple. If you want the user to be able to edit *many* fields from a given a Multiple, you can create a popup page and set up the Multiple to be edited there.

The general process to set up a Multiple to be edited in a popup page is:

1.  Add the parent field of the Multiple in question (at the DD level of the form’s primary file) to your form.

Add a popup page, dedicated to the DD number of the Multiple.

Link the popup page back to the Multiple’s parent field through the page’s PARENT FIELD property.

Add a block to the popup page.

Add the desired fields from the Multiple to the popup page’s block.

### Procedures

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this section, you will edit the DIVISION Multiple in a popup page:

1.  <u>Add the DIVISION Multiple Field</u>—Add the DIVISION field to the appropriate block on an existing page.
2.  <u>Add a Popup Page for the DIVISION Multiple</u>—Link that field to a popup page you will build, where you will place that Multiple’s fields.

#### Add the DIVISION Multiple Field

To add the DIVISION Multiple field to the Z*xxx* MAIN 3 block, do the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, go to Page 2 of your form:
1.  Press \<PF1\>P.
2.  Enter 2.

Position the cursor at row 10, column 7, and press \<PF2\>F to add a field.

Add the field to the block Z*xxx* MAIN 3:

1.  Accept the default field order.
2.  Make sure the field type is DATA DICTIONARY FIELD.
3.  Press \<PF1\>E to save the changes.

In the “Data Dictionary Field Properties” dialogue, do the following:

1.  Set FIELD to DIVISION.
2.  Press \<PF1\>E to save the field properties.

You should now see a field for DIVISION on the Form Editor screen.

#### Add a Popup Page for the DIVISION Multiple

To add a popup page for the DIVISION Multiple, do the following:

1.  Press \<PF2\>P to add a new page.
2.  One scheme for numbering popup pages is to number them as some fraction added to the page number from which they pop up.

Set the PAGE NUMBER field to 2.5, since this popup page “pops up” from Page 2.

Set the PAGE COORDINATE field to 5,5.

In the “Page Properties” dialogue, set the IS THIS A POP UP PAGE? field to YES.

Set the LOWER RIGHT COORDINATE field to 15,75.

Fill in PARENT FIELD. The format for PARENT FIELD is:

field id,block name,page name

Set PARENT FIELD to “DIVISION,Z*xxx* MAIN 3,2”. This links the popup page to the DIVISION field on block Z*xxx* MAIN 3, on Page 2.

## Add a ScreenMan Computed Field

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A ScreenMan computed field exists only on a form; it is *not* a data dictionary field. A computed field can be useful to display information that is computed “on-the-fly”.

The value of a ScreenMan computed field is determined by an M expression that sets the variable Y. In the M code (in the field’s COMPUTED EXPRESSION property), you can:

- Refer to values of other fields on the current block, by using the other field name in braces. For example:

{SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS}.

- Use navigational syntax when referring to fields as well. For example:

{SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS:MENU TEXT}.

### Procedure

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this section, you will add a computed field to the form to provide a user-friendly description for the list of secondary menu options you added in a previous lesson. The computed field uses navigational syntax to retrieve and display the MENU TEXT field value (from the OPTION file \[#19\]) based on the value of the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS field.

To add the computed field, do the following:

1.  Return to Page 2 of the form:
1.  Press \<PF1\>P.
2.  Choose Page 2.

On Page 2 of the form, position the cursor at row 5, column 50.

Press \<PF2\>F to add a field at the cursor position.

Place the new field on block Z*xxx* REPEATING 1:

- FIELD ORDER should be 3.
- FIELD TYPE should be COMPUTED.

Press \<PF1\>E to save the changes.

In the “Computed Field Properties” dialogue, set the COMPUTED EXPRESSION to be:

S Y={SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS:MENU TEXT}

This expression uses the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS field, which is on the same block as the computed field. It also uses navigational syntax to retrieve the value of the MENU TEXT field, which is in the OPTION file (#19) and is linked via the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS pointer field.

You should see a third underlined field on the Form Editor screen on row 5, with a length of 1.

Resize the field. To set the size of the new field, do the following:

1.  With the cursor positioned at the new field (its length is only 1), press PF3.
2.  The field should now be highlighted. Also, the R,C row/column indicator in the lower-right corner of the screen changes to L=1 (now indicating length of the field is 1).
3.  With the field highlighted, use the right-arrow key to expand the size of the field until its length is 25 (L=25 in indicator).
4.  Press PF3 again to “un-highlight” the field.

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Computed fields provide a way to display “on-the-fly” computed information to the user. Computed fields can be totally standalone, or can be based on the values of other fields on the same block.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/041.png) CONGRATULATIONS: This is the end of the second section of the hands-on tutorial! You have explored some of the advanced capabilities of ScreenMan forms, including:

- Adding pages to a form.
- Editing Multiples.
- Working with computed fields.

If you want to try out some more of the advanced features of ScreenMan, continue on to the next (and last) section of this tutorial!

# Advanced Features for Forms

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/042.png) NOTE: This section continues to build on the form you designed in Section <u>3</u>.

This section demonstrates some of finishing touches you can use to fine-tune your forms. It shows how to edit fields in another file, how to use branching logic, and how to use form-only fields to read user input. It also shows how to make a Kernel option out of your form. You will do the following:

- Edit fields in another file, using pointer navigation to reach the other file.
- Add branching logic for fields.
- Use ScreenMan Form-only fields for user input.
- Create a Kernel option to make the form accessible to users.

## Edit Fields in Other Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you create a form, you tie the form to a particular file. For example, the form you have been building is tied to the NEW PERSON file (#200).

You can edit fields in another file on your form, however. The easiest way is if there is a pointer field from the form’s primary file to the file you want to edit fields in. In this case:

1.  Your form’s primary file already has a forward pointer field to the other file.
2.  You need to add a new block (a block can only hold fields from one DD level).
3.  Tie the new block, through its POINTER LINK property, to the field that is the forward pointer in the primary file. The pointer link is the expression that describes the relational jump.
4.  Tie the new block, through its DD NUMBER property, to the data dictionary number of the other file.
5.  To edit fields in the other file, add them to the block that is tied to the DD number of the other file.

There are other types of relational navigation that can establish the link between files also:

- Backward pointers
- Lookups

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/043.png) REF: For more information on using other types of relational navigation in ScreenMan forms, see the “Relational Navigation” section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual*.

### Procedures

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this section you will:

1.  Add the SERVICE/SECTION pointer field to the form; it points from the NEW PERSON file (#200) to the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49).

Use that forward pointer field to navigate to the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49). This lets the form users edit the entry in the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49) being pointed to by the entry they are editing in the NEW PERSON file (#200).

#### Add the SERVICE/SECTION Field

To add the SERVICE/SECTION field to Page 2 of the form, do the following:

1.  Invoke the Form Editor, using either the menu option (see <u>Figure 2</u>) or the direct-mode utility (see Section <u>2.1.1.2.2</u>).

The first thing you are asked is for what file to create a form. Since we are creating a form to edit the NEW PERSON file (#200), enter NEW PERSON.

You are now asked for a form name. Entering two question marks lists current forms defined for the NEW PERSON file (#200). For this section, continue editing the form you created in Section <u>3</u>.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/044.png) NOTE: From hereon in, the namespace part of a name is referred to as “Z*xxx*” in the tutorial.

Once you select a name for the form, you are placed in the ScreenMan’s Form Editor.

On Page 2 of the form:

1.  Position the cursor at row 14, column 18.
2.  Press \<PF2\>F to add a new field at the cursor position.

When the Form Editor asks for block, make sure you choose Z*xxx* MAIN 3:

1.  Accept the default FIELD ORDER.
2.  Make sure the FIELD TYPE is DATA DICTIONARY FIELD.

Press \<PF1\>E to save and exit this dialogue.

When you reach the “Data Dictionary Field Properties“ dialogue, set FIELD to SERVICE/SECTION.

Press \<PF1\>E to save the new field.

#### Add a Block to Edit Fields

You can add a block to the form to edit fields in the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49). This allows users to edit several fields in the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49) for whichever entry they have selected as their current SERVICE/SECTION.

To add a block to edit fields in the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49), do the following:

1.  On Page 2 of the form:
1.  Position the cursor at row 12, column 7.
2.  Press \<PF2\>B to add a new block at the cursor position.
2.  Enter Z*xxx* POINTER 1 as the new block name.
3.  At the “Are you adding 'Z*xxx* POINTER 1' as a new BLOCK? No//” prompt, enter YES.
4.  At the “Are you adding Z*xxx* POINTER 1 as a new block on this page?” prompt, enter YES.
5.  In the “Block Properties Stored in FORM File” dialogue, the TYPE OF BLOCK should be EDIT.
6.  In the POINTER LINK field, enter SERVICE/SECTION. This is the navigational syntax needed to read fields in the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49) from the NEW PERSON file (#200).
7.  In the DD NUMBER field, enter 49. This is the DD number of the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49). This means that only SERVICE/SECTION file (#49) fields can be added as data dictionary fields to this block.
8.  The block properties should look like <u>Figure 45</u>:

#### Add Data Dictionary Fields

Once you have created the new block, do the following:

1.  Add fields to the block (Z*xxx* POINTER 1) in the usual manner.
2.  Position them below the SERVICE/SECTION field.
3.  Add the following three Data Dictionary fields from the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49) to the new block (Z*xxx* POINTER 1):
- MAIL SYMBOL (use a caption of “SERVICE MAIL SYMBOL”).
- CHIEF (use a caption of “SERVICE CHIEF”).
- ASST CHIEF (use a caption of “SERVICE ASST CHIEF”).

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/045.png) NOTE: To prevent the user from deleting or changing the name of the SERVICE/SECTION entry being edited, you are *not* letting users edit the .01 field.

Add caption fields above the four SERVICE/SECTION fields, with the heading “Service Information”.

Run and test the form. You should now be able to edit fields in the SERVICE/SECTION; this is accomplished by navigating from the NEW PERSON file (#200) via the SERVICE/SECTION field!

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use ScreenMan to edit the fields in any associated entry from another file. Fields from another file *must* be placed on their own block, and the navigational link to the block is described through the block’s POINTER LINK property.

## Add Branching Logic for Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can automatically branch the user from one field on the form to another by setting the DDSBR variable in the BRANCHING LOGIC field property. The BRANCHING LOGIC is executed when the user presses Enter at the field.

The following variables are defined for any code executed from a field’s BRANCHING LOGIC property (and other properties that accept M code):

| Variable | Value                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| X        | Current internal value of the field.  |
| DDSEXT   | Current external value of the field.  |
| DDSOLD   | Previous internal value of the field. |

<span id="_Toc395709633" class="anchor"></span>Table . BRANCHING LOGIC property Variables

To jump to another field on the form, you can set the DDSBR variable in the original field’s BRANCHING LOGIC field. You should set the DDSBR variable in the following format:

Field ID^Block ID^Page ID

Where:

| Piece    | Value                                                                              |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Field ID | Caption of field, Unique Name of field, or Field Order number of field to jump to. |
| Block ID | Block Order number or Block Name to jump to.                                       |
| Page ID  | Page Number or Page Name to jump to.                                               |

<span id="_Toc395709634" class="anchor"></span>Table . DDSBR Variable Format Pieces

### Procedure

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this example, you will add branching logic to the OFFICE PHONE field, which is on page 1 of the form. You set up the branching logic so that if there is a defined value for OFFICE PHONE, the user goes directly to the SERVICE/SECTION fields on Page 2 of the form. If there is *not* a defined value, the user stays on Page 1.

#### Add Branching Logic

To add branching logic to the OFFICE PHONE field, do the following:

1.  Go to Page 1 of the form:
1.  Press \<PF1\>P.
2.  Choose Page 1.
2.  Move the cursor to the OFFICE PHONE field caption, and select it.
3.  With the OFFICE PHONE selected, press PF4 to edit its field properties. In the BRANCHING LOGIC field property, enter:

S:\$L(X) DDSBR=“SERVICE/SECTION^Z*xxx* MAIN 3^PAGE 2”

This code conditionally branches to the field with the “SERVICE/SECTION” caption, on block Z*xxx* MAIN 3, on Page 2 of the form, provided that there is a defined value for the OFFICE PHONE field.

4.  Press \<PF1\>E to save the changed field properties.
5.  Press \<PF1\>E to save the form and exit.
6.  Run and test the form:
1.  Enter a value for OFFICE PHONE. You should branch immediately to the SERVICE/SECTION fields on Page 2 of the form.
2.  Go back and delete the value for OFFICE PHONE. In this case, the branching logic should leave you where you are, on Page 1 of the form.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/046.png) TIP: Other Properties Where You Can Set DDSBR:  
  
You can also set the DDSBR variable at the field level properties PRE ACTION, POST ACTION, and POST ACTION ON CHANGE, as well as at the form level property DATA VALIDATION. You can set the DDSSTACK variable only at the field level BRANCHING LOGIC property, however.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/047.png) TIP: Using DDSSTACK to “Stack” Another Form Location:  
  
Rather than simply “going” to another location on the form using the DDSBR variable, you can “stack” another location of the form using the DDSSTACK variable. The difference with the DDSSTACK variable is that when a user jumps to another location, does their work, and closes the jumped to page, they are returned to the original page. DDSBR, on the other hand, acts similarly to the M GOTO command; the user is not returned to their original location after a jump.

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use branching logic to conditionally branch from one location on a form to another location on the form; even if the locations are on different pages.

## Use Form-Only Fields for User Input

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

ScreenMan provides Form-Only fields as a way to read user input without tying that input to a dictionary field. They act similarly to the VA FileMan ^DIR reader call, allowing you to read data as a VA FileMan data type (e.g., Free Text, Yes/No, Numeric, etc.)

To use form only fields, do the following:

1.  Create a field and set the field type to FORM ONLY.
2.  In the field’s properties, under FORM ONLY FIELD PARAMETERS, set the field’s READ TYPE property to reflect the type of read you want to do.
3.  To retrieve the value of the field in M code, you can refer to the regular variables for a field:
- X (current internal value)
- DDSEXT (current external value)
- DDSOLD (previous internal value)

### Procedure

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Add a form-only field to Page 1 of the form, asking the user whether they want to jump to page 2 of the form or *not*. If they answer YES, you use the DDSBR variable to branch them to Page 2 of the form.

To add a form-only field, do the following:

1.  Go to Page 1 of the form:
1.  Press \<PF1\>P.
2.  Choose Page 1.

Move the cursor to row 16, column 8:

1.  Press \<PF2\>F to add a field.
2.  Add the field to the Z*xxx* MAIN 2 block.
3.  Choose FORM ONLY as the FIELD TYPE.

In the “Form Only Field Properties” dialogue:

1.  Press Enter at the FORM ONLY FIELD PARAMETERS… field.
2.  In the “Other Form Only Field Properties” dialogue, set the READ TYPE field to “YES OR NO”. This makes the field read a YES or NO response from the user.
3.  Press \<PF1\>E to save the new field parameters.

2.  If you answer NO, you should stay on the current page.

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use form-only fields to read a variety of input from the user, *without* that input having to be tied to a data dictionary field.

## Turn Your ScreenMan Form into an Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Until now, you have been running your form using ScreenMan’s Run a Form option. However, end-users would need your form set up as an option. This section shows you how to turn the form into an option in the menu system.

The two most typical ways to set up an option for a ScreenMan form are:

- Create a Run Routine-type option, and a routine to run.
- Create a ScreenMan-type option.

In either case (Run Routine or ScreenMan-type option), your option needs to:

1.  Determine the record number of the NEW PERSON file (#200) entry to edit.
2.  Call ScreenMan and load the form once the record number is known (^DDS entry point).

### Procedures

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Create a Run-Routine-Type Option

To create a Run Routine-type option, do the following:

1.  Create a routine that determines the record number to edit (use the ^DIC entry point).
2.  Invoke ScreenMan (^DDS entry point) to edit the record.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/048.png) REF: For more information on these entry points, see the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

<u>Table 5</u> lists the input variables you need for the ^DDS entry point:

| Input Variable | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DDSFILE    | The number or global root of the primary file of the form.                                                                                       |
| DR         | The name of the form, enclosed in square brackets (\[ \]).                                                                                   |
| DA         | The record number of the file entry to display or edit.                                                                                          |
| DDSPAGE    | (Optional) The page number of the first page to display to the user. If DDSPAGE is *not* defined, there *must* be a page number = 1 in the form. |
| DDSPARM    | (Optional) Flags controlling return values from ScreenMan.                                                                                       |

<span id="_Ref390252840" class="anchor"></span>Table . ^DDS Entry Point—Input Variables

Clone the routine in <u>Figure 50</u> in your namespace. This routine does the following:

- Determines the record number of the NEW PERSON file (#200) entry to edit.
- Calls ^DDS.

.D ^DDS

Create a “Run Routine”-type option that calls EN^Z*xxx*ED1 as the routine to run.

Run the option.

You should now have a Menu Manager option that runs your form!

#### Create a ScreenMan-Type Option

You can quickly set up a ScreenMan-type option to run your form. This option does exactly what the run routine-type option shown above does:

1.  Uses ^DIC to determine a record to edit \[controlled by the DIC {DIC} and DIC(0) fields\].

Uses ^DDS to load your ScreenMan form \[controlled by the DR{DDS}, DDSFILE, and DDSPAGE fields\].

To create a ScreenMan-type option, do the following:

1.  Set up the option as shown in <u>Figure 51</u> (substitute your namespace for Z*xxx*). Setting up the option this way is quicker than writing a routine!

<span id="_Ref390253520" class="anchor"></span>Figure . Sample ScreenMan-type option setup

NAME: Z*xxx* NEW PERSON EDIT MENU TEXT: Z*xxx* NEW PERSON EDIT

TYPE: ScreenMan

DIC {DIC}: VA(200, DIC(0): AEMQ

DR{DDS}: \[Z*xxx* EDIT\] DDSFILE: 200

DDSPAGE: 1

UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: Z*xxx* NEW PERSON EDIT

2.  Run and test the option.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/049.png) TIP: Record Selection within ScreenMan:  
  
The options in this lesson determine what record to edit before invoking ScreenMan. To edit a subsequent record, the user must exit ScreenMan, choose another record, and then enter ScreenMan again. You can, however, set up a Record Selection Page to allow record selection to happen within ScreenMan. To do this:

1.  *Add a popup page to your form.*
2.  *Add an edit block to the page.*
12. *Add one field to this page: a pointer-type form-only field.*
13. *In the Qualifiers property of the form-only field, specify the number of the file that is your ScreenMan form’s primary file.*
14. *Set the field’s caption to something like “Choose a record to edit”, and set its data length property to an appropriate size for entering the name of a record in your file.*
15. *Set the form-level property Record Selection Page to the page number of this page.*

Once you have done this, you can invoke ^DDS without specifying the DA of the record to edit; with no DA, ScreenMan uses the record selection page to prompt the user to choose a record. Once they are editing a record, the user can press \<PF1\>L to choose another record to edit, without leaving ScreenMan.

### Summary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To run your form from an option, you can make either a run routine or ScreenMan-type option. In either case, the option *must*:

1.  Determines the record number to edit from your form’s primary file.

Calls ^DDS to invoke ScreenMan.

## Where to Go From Here

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/050.png) CONGRATULATIONS: This is the end of the hands-on tutorial!

At this point, you have done the following:

- Built a ScreenMan form from scratch.
- Enhanced the form with a number of advanced ScreenMan features.
- Made a Kernel option out of the form.

You can try creating ScreenMan forms for your own projects now. Feel free to turn back to this tutorial as you do so.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/051.png) REF: For a full reference for the ScreenMan Form Editor and other ScreenMan features, see the “ScreenMan” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual.*  
  
For a full reference on the ScreenMan API, see the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

Challenge yourself; the sky is the limit!

<u>Figure 52</u> is just one example of the kind of visually appealing, usable forms that you can create with ScreenMan:

<span id="_Ref390253989" class="anchor"></span>Figure . Sample finished, detailed ScreenMan form

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/052.png)

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/053.png) NOTE: Some additional features of ScreenMan and the Form Editor are *not* covered by this tutorial. For example, there are additional properties for fields, blocks, pages, and forms that are *not* described in this tutorial.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/054.png) REF: For more information on these additional properties and other ScreenMan and Form Editor features, see the “ScreenMan” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

## Delete a Form

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

As a final step in the tutorial, you can delete your test form.

To delete a form, do the following:

1.  Use the Delete a Form option, which is on the same menu (ScreenMan) as the Edit/Create a Form and Run a Form options.
2.  Select the form to be deleted. When you choose a form to delete with the Delete a Form option, it lists all blocks on the form, noting whether or *not* the blocks are used on any other form.

![](fm-screenman-tutorial-for-developers/055.png) NOTE: None of the blocks you have used in this tutorial should be part of any other form.

3.  The option asks whether to delete all “deletable” blocks on your form. For the form you have built for this tutorial, you should answer YES.
4.  The option then deletes your form and all “deletable” blocks on your form.

# Appendix A—M Code and Variables in ScreenMan Forms

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## M code in Field Properties

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can enter M code for the following field properties:

- Branching Logic
- Pre Action
- Post Action
- Post Action on Change
- Data Validation

The M code for these properties can rely on the variables listed in <u>Table 6</u>, which are being defined by ScreenMan:

| Variable | Description                               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| X        | The current internal value of the field.  |
| DDSEXT   | The current external value of the field.  |
| DDSOLD   | The previous internal value of the field. |

<span id="_Ref390254704" class="anchor"></span>Table . ScreenMan-defined M Code Variables

You can also enter M code in a field’s Executable Caption and Executable Default properties, but you *cannot* depend on the X, DDSEXT, or DDSOLD variables.

## Variables

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### DDSBR Variable

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

ScreenMan allows you to conditionally branch the user to a field. This can be done with M code in the:

- Branching Logic
- Pre Action
- Post Action
- Post Action on Change properties at the field-level
- Data Validation property at the form-level

The M code should set the DDSBR variable to the location of the field to which you wish to take the user. The DDSBR variable should be set in the following format:

Field ID^Block ID^Page ID”

Where:

| Piece    | Value                                                          |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Field ID | Caption of field, Unique Name of field, or Field Order number. |
| Block ID | Block Order number or Block Name.                              |
| Page ID  | Page Number or Page Name.                                      |

<span id="_Ref390255301" class="anchor"></span>Table . Form Levels Used M code in Property Fields

For example:

S:X=“Y” DDSBR=“FIELD 1^BLOCK 1^PAGE 2”

This takes the user to the field with unique name or caption “FIELD 1” on the block named “BLOCK 1” on the page named “PAGE 2”, if the internal value of the field = Y.

### DDSSTACK Variable

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The DDSSTACK variable can be set only in the Branching Logic property of a field. It can be used to branch users to another page when they press Enter at the field. After the user closes the page defined in DDSSTACK, ScreenMan takes the user back to the parent page, to the field *immediately* following the field from which the branch occurred.

For example, set DDSSTACK equal to the Page Number or Page Name:

S:X=“Y” DDSSTACK=“Page 1.1”

This takes the user to Page 1.1 if the internal value of the field is “Y” and the user presses Enter at the field. When Page 1.1 is closed, the user returns to the parent page, to the field *immediately* following the field from which the branch occurred.

ScreenMan provides another way to achieve this kind of “branch and return” behavior. You can link a field to a subpage by defining a Subpage Link for the field or by defining a Parent Field for the subpage. The Subpage Link and Parent Field methods, however, do *not* allow branching conditionally.

## Other Places for M Code in Forms

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Besides the field-level, you can use M code at the following levels:

- Form
- Page
- Block

<u>Table 7</u> lists the levels in a form that you can use M code in property fields:

<table>
<caption><p><span id="_Toc395709638" class="anchor"></span>Table . Page Navigation</p></caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 89%" />

<p>Pre Action or Post Action (stored in the BLOCK file [#.404]).</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<span id="_Toc395709638" class="anchor"></span>Table . Page Navigation

## Validating Data

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

ScreenMan uses the definition of a field to automatically validate values inputted by the user. You can use the Data Validation property of a field to validate the value even further.

Data Validation is M code that is executed *after* a user enters a new value for a field and *after* the automatic validation that ScreenMan normally performs. If the M code sets the DDSERROR variable, ScreenMan rejects the value. You might also want to ring the bell and make a call to HLP^DDSUTL to display a message to the user that indicates the reason the value was rejected.
