What is VA FileMan?

VA FileMan is the database management system for the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture user (VistA) environment. VA FileMan creates and maintains a database management system that includes features such as:

- Report writer
- Data dictionary manager
- Scrolling and screen-oriented data entry
- Text editors
- Programming utilities
- Tools for sending data to other systems
- File archiving

VA FileMan can be used as a:

- Standalone database
- Set of interactive or “silent” routines
- Set of application utilities, in all modes

It is used to define, enter, and retrieve information from a set of computer-stored files, each of which is described by a data dictionary.

VA FileMan is a public domain software package that is developed and maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It is widely used by VA medical centers and in clinical, administrative, and business settings in this country and abroad.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/004.png) CAUTION: Programmer access in VistA is defined as DUZ(0)=“@”. It grants the privilege to become a developer in VistA. Programmer access allows you to work outside many of the security controls enforced by VA FileMan, enables access to all VA FileMan files, access to modify data dictionaries, etc. It is important to *proceed with caution* when having access to the system in this way.

How to Use this Manual

The VA FileMan User Manual is comprised of two separate documents that describe the VA FileMan functionality of VistA’s database management system:

- The *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual* (this manual) shows how to use the features of VA FileMan that are likely to be used by experienced VistA users. It introduces advanced VA FileMan concepts and shows you how to use VA FileMan’s advanced tools. It describes features that are more likely to be used by:
- Automated Data Processing Application Coordinators (ADPACs)
- System Administrators
- Other technical users
- The *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual* introduces basic VA FileMan concepts. It shows you how to use:
- VA FileMan’s basic tools for displaying and editing data.
- VA FileMan features that are used in most VistA applications, which are used by all VistA users.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/005.png) NOTE: These documents are available in Microsoft Word (.docx), Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format (see the “[HTML Manuals](#_Toc446123252)” section).

In this manual, the following major features of VA FileMan are introduced along with a description on how to use them:

- <u>Menus and Options</u>.
- <u>Import and Export Tools</u>.
- <u>Relational Navigation</u>.
- <u>Advanced Edit Techniques</u>.
- <u>Computed Expressions</u>.
- <u>VA FileMan Functions</u>.
- <u>Statistics</u>.
- <u>System Management</u>.
- <u>List File Attributes</u>.
- <u>Creating Files and Fields</u>.
- <u>File Utilities</u>.
- <u>Auditing</u>.
- <u>Data Security</u>.
- <u>Transferring File Entries</u>.
- <u>Extract Tool</u>.
- <u>Filegrams</u>.
- <u>Archiving</u>.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/006.png) REF: For VA FileMan installation instructions in the VistA environment see the *VA FileMan Installation Guide* and any national patch description of the patch being released.

<span id="_Toc446123252" class="anchor"></span>HTML Manuals

Why produce an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) edition of the VA FileMan User Manual?

- The HTML versions of the VA FileMan manuals are useful as online documentation support as you use VA FileMan. HTML manuals allow you to instantly jump (link) to specific topics or references online.
- The VA FileMan HTML manuals are “living” documents that are continuously updated with the most current VA FileMan information (unlike paper or printed documentation). They are updated based on new versions, patches, or enhancements to VA FileMan.
- Presenting manuals in an HTML format on a Web server also gives new opportunities, such as accessing embedded multimedia training material (e.g., movies) directly in the manuals themselves.
- Manuals are accessible over the VA Intranet network.

Intended Audience

The intended audience of this manual is all key stakeholders. The stakeholders include the following:

- Automated Data Processing Application Coordinators (ADPACs)
- System Administrators—System administrators at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sites who are responsible for computer management and system security on the VistA M Servers.
- Product Delivery Service (PDS)—VistA legacy development teams.
- Product Support (PS).

<span id="_Ref386465924" class="anchor"></span>Table 2: Import and Export Tools—Foreign Format Field Prompts

- Descriptive text is presented in a proportional font (as represented by this font).
- Conventions for displaying TEST data in this document are as follows:
- The first three digits (prefix) of any Social Security Numbers (SSN) begin with either “000” or “666”.
- Patient and user names are formatted as follows:
- \<Application Name/Abbreviation/Namespace\>PATIENT,\<N\>
- \<Application Name/Abbreviation/Namespace\>USER,\<N\>

Where:

- *\<Application Name/Abbreviation/Namespace\>* is defined in the Approved Application Abbreviations document.
- *\<N\>* represents the first name as a number spelled out and incremented with each new entry.

For example, in Kernel (DI or FM) test patient and user names would be documented as follows:

FMPATIENT,ONE; FMPATIENT,TWO; FMPATIENT,THREE; … FMPATIENT,14; etc.

FMUSER,ONE; FMUSER,TWO; FMUSER,THREE; … FMUSER,14; etc.

- “Snapshots” of computer online displays (i.e., screen captures/dialogs) and computer source code, if any, are shown in a *non*-proportional font and enclosed within a box.
- User’s responses to online prompts are bold typeface and highlighted in yellow (e.g., <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>).
- Emphasis within a dialog box is bold typeface and highlighted in blue (e.g.,<span class="mark"> STANDARD LISTENER: RUNNING</span>).
- Some software code reserved/key words are bold typeface with alternate color font.
- References to “\<Enter\>” within these snapshots indicate that the user should press the Enter key on the keyboard. Other special keys are represented within \< \> angle brackets. For example, pressing the PF1 key can be represented as pressing \<PF1\>.
- Author’s comments are displayed in italics or as “callout” boxes.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/012.png) NOTE: Callout boxes refer to labels or descriptions usually enclosed within a box, which point to specific areas of a displayed image.

- All uppercase is reserved for the representation of M code, variable names, or the formal name of options, field/file names, and security keys (e.g., DIEXTRACT).

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/013.png) NOTE: Other software code (e.g., Delphi/Pascal and Java) variable names and file/folder names can be written in lower or mixed case (e.g., CamelCase).

# Import and Export Tools

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you want to use an application like Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Excel to manipulate data stored in a VA FileMan file, you need some way to exchange that data between VA FileMan and your application. VA FileMan provides the Import and Export Tools for this purpose.

Suppose, for example, that you want to use Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Word’s Print Merge utility to print a form letter to a list of recipients that is maintained in a VA FileMan file. You can use VA FileMan’s Export Tool to export the list of recipients from the VA FileMan file to Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Word. Once you have done this, you can use Word to generate your form letters based on the exported list.

## What Applications Can You Exchange Data With?

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In theory, you can exchange data with any application that supports delimited or fixed-length ASCII data exchange. Many applications do, using a variety of formats. Typically, you can expect the ability to import and export data with the following types of applications:

- Databases
- Spreadsheets
- Statistical and Analysis Programs (SAS, SPSS, etc.)
- Vertical Applications
- Word Processor (data records, *not* word-processing text)

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/019.png) NOTE: You can export data records to a word-processor, which often uses data records for functions such as print merges. You *cannot* use the Import or Export Tools to exchange WORD-PROCESSING fields from VA FileMan files, however.

## How Data is Moved between Applications

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Movement of data between applications that do *not* “speak the same language” is a complex process, because it involves coordinating activities in different computer applications and often in multiple computing environments.

VA FileMan’s Import and Export Tools use ASCII data exchange. It is the oldest and most widely supported way of exchanging data between applications. Data for a particular record or group of records can be transported in one of two standard formats:

- Delimited
- Fixed-length

To *export* data from a VA FileMan file, use the Export Tool to create an ASCII data file containing exported records. The exported data is formatted in such a way that it can be recognized by a particular foreign application. The ASCII data file can then be imported into the foreign application.

To *import* data to a VA FileMan file, use your foreign application to generate an ASCII data file containing records in either delimited or fixed-length formats. Then use the Import Tool to load those records into the VA FileMan file you specify.

## Dependency on Correct Data Communication

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

For import or export of data to succeed, the data *must* be passed correctly on all communication pathways between VA FileMan and the foreign application. A glitch in the communication of data can cause data exchange to fail.

For example, suppose the foreign application expects the fields in records you are exporting to be separated (or “delimited”) by the Tab character (\<TAB\>). The Export Tool can output a \<TAB\> between each field’s data value. However, if you use a communication program’s screen capture facility to create a file of the exported data and if that communication program automatically changes \<TAB\>s into a certain number of spaces to align text, the exported data is corrupted, and the import fails.

You should be familiar with your importing or exporting application and with any communications programs that you are using. Knowledge of all the applications involved, starting with VA FileMan and its Import and Export Tools, increases the likelihood of a successful transfer of data.

### Data Formats

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Delimited Data Format

Suppose you have a record with the following data:

- LASTNAME = “FMPATIENT”
- FIRSTNAME = “ONE”
- AGE = “36”

In delimited data format, you choose a delimiter character to place between field values. For this example, use a comma (,) as the delimiter character.

A comma (,) is then inserted between each of a record’s fields, to “delimit” them. The resulting record, exported in comma-delimited format, would look like <u>Figure 5</u>:

<span id="_Ref462325895" class="anchor"></span>Figure 5: Import and Export Tools—Example of a Record Delimited by a Comma

FMPATIENT,ONE,36

Groups of records are exported line-by-line, one line after another. A file of records in comma-delimited format might look like <u>Figure 6</u>:

<span id="_Ref462325873" class="anchor"></span>Figure 6: Import and Export Tools—Example of a File with Records Delimited by a Comma

FMPATIENT,TWO,1 GREEN LANE,,,Amherst,NH,99999

FMPATIENT,THREE,0 Plaza Court,,,San Francisco,CA,99999

FMPATIENT,FOUR,0 123rd St.,,,San Francisco,CA,99999

To use delimited data format, both applications (the exporting application and the importing application) *must* be able to recognize the format.

#### Quoted Fields in Delimited Format

Now, suppose in the previous example that instead of two separate fields for LASTNAME and FIRSTNAME, there is only a single NAME field for both. Suppose that incoming data you want to place in the single NAME field comes in the form FMPATIENT,FOUR, but you still want to use commas as your delimiter. You can use the “Fields Quoted” setting in the Import form (or the Quote Non-Numeric Fields setting in a Foreign Format) to ignore the delimiter if it is between quotes in the incoming data.

Thus, if you set “Fields Quoted” to YES in your import form, and you pass in a record that looks like <u>Figure 7</u>:

<span id="_Ref462325850" class="anchor"></span>Figure 7: Import and Export Tools—Example of a Record Where the Delimiter between Quotes is Ignored

"FMPATIENT,FOUR",0 123rd St.,,,San Francisco,CA,99999

For quoted fields, like “FMPATIENT,FOUR”, the Import Tool ignores the comma delimiter between the quotes and treats “FMPATIENT,FOUR” as a single field value.

#### Fixed-Length Data Format

In fixed-length data format, a standard width is expected for each field in the record. For example, suppose you have a record with the following data:

- LASTNAME = “FMPATIENT”; 25 characters for LASTNAME.
- FIRSTNAME = “ONE”; 20 characters for FIRSTNAME.
- AGE = “36”; 3 characters for AGE.

The resulting record, exported in fixed-length format, would look like <u>Figure 8</u>:<span id="_Ref462325815" class="anchor"></span>

Figure 8: Import and Export Tools—Example of a Fixed-Length Record

FMPATIENT ONE 36

Groups of records are exported line-by-line, one line after another. A file of records in fixed-length format might look like <u>Figure 9</u>:<span id="_Ref462325785" class="anchor"></span>

Figure 9: Import and Export Tools—Example of a File with Fixed-Length Records

FMPATIENT TWO 29

FMPATIENT THREE 47

FMPATIENT FOUR 38

To use fixed-length data format, both applications (the exporting application and the importing application) *must* be able to recognize the format.

### How to Export Data

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The menu in <u>Figure 10</u> shows the export data options, which are located under the Other Options \[DIOTHER\] menu:

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/020.png) NOTE: The Export Data option \[DDXP EXPORT DATA\] is used to stream data to external devices or files. It is *not* designed to print clearly to the screen.

If you know how to print file entries, you already know most of the procedures to export file entries. The Export Tool is based on the standard VA FileMan Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/021.png) REF: For more information on the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option, see the “Print: How to Print Reports from Files” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

The Export Tool creates a specially formatted print output. Some limitations apply to data exports that do *not* apply to setting up a regular print (e.g., WORD-PROCESSING-type fields *cannot* be exported). Some capabilities are available when exporting that are *not* when you are printing (e.g., the records you export can be longer than 245 characters, if you are using a delimited format; see the description of the Maximum Output Length FOREIGN FORMAT attribute below). These differences are discussed below.

The steps to export data are:

1.  <u>Make Sure a FOREIGN FORMAT File Entry is Available</u>—Make sure there is a FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file entry available to export your data in the format expected by the receiving application.
2.  <u>Select Fields for Export Option</u> \[DDXP SELECT EXPORT FIELDS\]—Use this option to select the fields you want to export. This creates a SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template.
3.  <u>Create Export Template Option</u> \[DDXP CREATE EXPORT TEMPLATE\]—Use this option to create an EXPORT template. This is where you combine the SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template with a desired FOREIGN FORMAT.
4.  <u>Choose Entries/Export Data</u>—Use the Export Data option \[DDXP EXPORT DATA\]. This is where you select which entries to export and perform the export.

#### Make Sure a FOREIGN FORMAT File Entry is Available

First, you need to determine an ASCII data format (some form of delimited or fixed-length) that your foreign application recognizes. This is the format you need the Export Tool to generate.

This data format *must* be set up in advance, as an entry in the FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file. The following are the major format parameters stored in a FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file entry:

- What delimiters are used between fields?
- Does the export use fixed length fields?
- What headers to output before the body of the data, and what footers after the data
- Any special formatting for specific DATA TYPE field values (e.g., dates and numbers)?

Some formats are already set up in advance in the FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file, targeted towards specific foreign applications. These include:

- Word Data File (Comma)
- Excel (Comma)
- Excel (Tab)
- 1-2-3 Import Numbers
- 1-2-3 Data Parse
- Oracle (Delimited)

Keep in mind that applications are often updated. A format that worked for one version may *not* work for a different version, or a more efficient, simpler format might be possible for a different version.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/022.png) REF: The full details of the export parameters that can be set up for exporting are described in the “<u>FOREIGN FORMAT File Attributes Reference</u>” section.

In many cases, you can use an existing FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file entry for your export. If you need to create a *new* FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file entry (rather than using an existing entry), set up the new entry with the Define Foreign File Format \[DDXP DEFINE FORMAT\] option.

#### Select Fields for Export Option

With the <u>Define Foreign File Format Option</u> \[DDXP DEFINE FORMAT\], you determined the data format for your export and made sure there was a corresponding FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file entry. The next step is to choose what file and field data to export. Do this using the Select Fields for Export \[DDXP SELECT EXPORT FIELDS\] option; this creates a SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template.

The process of creating a SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template is very similar to the way you choose fields for printing with the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/023.png) REF: For details on selecting fields, see the “Choosing Print Fields” section in the “Print: How to Print Reports from Files” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

First, you *must* identify the file from which you are exporting data. This is the primary file. Then you choose from which fields to export data.

In addition to fields from that file and its Multiples, you can export data from other files by using the extended pointer syntax.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/024.png) REF: For more information on pointer syntax, see the “<u>Relational Navigation</u>” section.

Also, you can put other computed expressions at the “EXPORT FIELD:” prompt to make use of VA FileMan functions or M code.

There are several kinds of specifications that are valid at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompt that are *not* allowed at the “EXPORT FIELD:” prompt. They are:

- WORD-PROCESSING-type fields.
- “ALL” signifying all the fields in a file.
- Print qualifiers following the field designation (e.g., “;X” or “;C22”).
- Statistical print qualifiers preceding the field (e.g., \# or &).
- Backward extended pointers.
- Relational jumps to other files (i.e.,use of a terminating colon); instead, use the full extended pointer syntax to obtain data from other files.
- Specifications that return more than one value (e.g., a Multiple in a pointed-to file); you can specify Multiples in the primary file.

After you enter a set of field specifications, you are *immediately* prompted for a template in which to store the selected fields. You *must* store your field specifications in a template to proceed with the next step in the data export. After you specify a template name for the SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template, you have completed this step.

<u>Figure 11</u> is an example of the “EXPORT FIELD:” dialog. The example uses the sample PATIENT (#2) file. Several unacceptable responses are shown; the error messages are the ones you would receive to these responses:

Select DATA EXPORT TO FOREIGN FORMAT OPTION:

SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS templates are sometimes referred to as PRINT templates in the user dialog. This is because they are stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/025.png) NOTE: Even though you *cannot* “jump” to the RELIGION (#13) file using the RELIGION field, which is a pointer to the RELIGION (#13) file, you can retrieve data from that file by using extended pointer syntax.  
  
REF: For more information on pointer syntax, see the “<u>Relational Navigation</u>” section.

You can edit a SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template. The editing *must* occur in the Export Data \[DDXP EXPORT DATA\] option, *not* in the standard Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option. To edit one, enter the template name at the “FIRST EXPORT FIELD:” prompt preceded by a left bracket ( \[ ).

If an EXPORT template (see Section <u>2.3.2.3</u>, “<u>Create Export Template Option</u>”) has been created based on the SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template that you edit, the SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template are *not* updated to reflect the changes. You *must* create a new SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template to make use of the changes.

#### Create Export Template Option

The next step to export data is to create an EXPORT template with the Create Export Template \[DDXP CREATE EXPORT TEMPLATE\] option. The EXPORT template combines the SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template (created in Step 2; Section <u>2.3.2.2</u>, “<u>Select Fields for Export Option</u>”) with a FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file (see Step 1; Section <u>2.3.2.1</u>, “<u>Make Sure a FOREIGN FORMAT File Entry is Available</u>”).

Besides choosing a SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template and a FOREIGN FORMAT, you are asked for any additional information that is needed to fully define the export. If you do *not* supply the requested information, the EXPORT template *cannot* be created. Values in the FOREIGN FORMAT entry you choose determine whether you are prompted for more information.

Enter Yes or No: NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

When asked if you want the SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template deleted, answer YES only if you know you do *not* need the template again. If an EXPORT template is *not* successfully created, the SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template is *not* deleted.

Next, identify the FOREIGN FORMAT to use, and name the EXPORT template that you are creating. You *cannot* overwrite an existing PRINT template:

<span id="_Ref446997026" class="anchor"></span>Figure 13: Import and Export Tools—Identifying the FOREIGN FORMAT and EXPORT Templates

After you choose the EXPORT template name, you are prompted for any additional information needed. In this example, the format does require additional information: the DATA TYPE field value for each field (in this situation the defaults derived by the Export Tool are correct) and the maximum length of each record:

The Export Tool checks to make sure that your SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template does *not* contain fields from Subfiles (Multiples) that are *not* descendent from each other.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/026.png) REF: For more information on Subfiles (Multiples), see the “<u>Exporting Data from Multiples</u>” section.

If you have *not* followed that restriction, you receive an error message. The SELECTED EXPORT FIELDS template would have to be modified.

#### Choose Entries/Export Data

In the final step to export data, use the Export Data \[DDXP EXPORT DATA\] option to select which entries from the file to export, and then perform the export.

First, choose which entries to export with a “SEARCH” dialog; then choose the order of the exported entries with a “SORT BY” dialog (you are *not* given the “SORT BY” dialog, if you are exporting fields from Subfiles.) Finally, specify the device to send the exported data.

During either the Search or Sort process, you can use previously created SEARCH and SORT templates. Those templates need *not* have been originally made during a data export; however, SORT templates that contain unacceptable qualifiers should *not* be used. At the “SORT BY:” prompt, you can only use the subset of sort qualifiers shown in <u>Table 3</u>:

| Sort Qualifier | Description                                                                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‘          | To *not* sort. Used when you want to use the “FROM … TO” dialog to restrict the entries to be exported. |
| -          | To sort in reverse order.                                                                               |
| ;Ln        | To sort on the first *n*-characters only.                                                           |
| ;TXT       | To sort following strict ASCII sorting sequence.                                                        |

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/027.png) REF: For more detailed information about searching and sorting, see the “Print: How to Print Reports from Files” and “Search” sections in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

#### Export Example

<u>Figure 15</u> is an example of an export using the “PATIENT TO 123” EXPORT template created in the previous section (<u>Figure 13</u> and <u>Figure 14</u>). You begin by identifying the file and the EXPORT template that you want to use for the export. Do *not* enclose the template’s name with brackets. Again, you can delete the EXPORT template after a successful export.

Because there is a Multiple involved, you are told that you do *not* have the opportunity to sort. Then, you are given the opportunity to search the file for entries to export.

<span id="_Ref389629584" class="anchor"></span>Figure 15: Import and Export Tools—Searching for Entries to be Exported

Select DATA EXPORT TO FOREIGN FORMAT OPTION: <span class="mark">EXPORT DATA</span>

Do you want to delete the PATIENT TO 123 template

after the data export is complete?

Enter Yes or No: NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Since you are exporting fields from multiples,

a sort will be done automatically.

You will not have the opportunity to sort the data before export.

Do you want to SEARCH for entries to be exported? NO// <span class="mark">YES</span>

-A- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: <span class="mark">DATE OF BIRTH</span>

-A- CONDITION: <span class="mark">\< \<Enter\></span> LESS THAN

-A- LESS THAN DATE: <span class="mark">1980 \<Enter\></span> (1980)

-B- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

IF: A// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> DATE OF BIRTH LESS THAN 1980 (1980)

STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

If Multiples had *not* been involved, you would now be able to respond to the SORT BY dialog. You can do the same things with sort here that you can do when using the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option.

#### What Device to Send Export Data To

After you complete the sort dialog, you are immediately given the “DEVICE:” prompt. Choose to which device the exported data should be sent:

<span id="_Toc342980617" class="anchor"></span>Figure 16: Import and Export Tools—Choosing a Device to Send Exported Data

DEVICE: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

If you press the Enter key at the “DEVICE:” prompt, the export output is displayed on your *screen*. Sending the formatted export data to the screen allows you to use a PC-based screen capture to put the data into a file. This file would be a readable ASCII file on that computer. This method of transferring the data into a file is a simple one that is often successful and convenient, especially if the importing application is on the same PC.

When using a screen capture to create a file from the exported data, you *must* consider the peculiarities of your communication and terminal emulation software. Your communication application, for example, can intercept certain control characters (like the \<TAB\>, ASCII 9) and convert them into something else. This can cause the import to fail. Also, your terminal emulation can *automatically* “break” lines at 80 characters by inserting an unwanted carriage return or line feed. When emulating VT-100 and other ANSI terminals, you can avoid this last problem by turning wraparound mode off.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/028.png) CAUTION: When exporting data to your terminal’s screen, there are no page breaks. Therefore, there is no graceful way to interrupt the export once it has begun.

#### Sending Export Data to a Host File

Having data printed on-screen is of little use if you are using a terminal with no screen-capture capabilities. An alternative is to send the data to a file on the host system, for example, to a VMS file if you are using DSM. Another advantage to sending data to a Host file is that only the exported data is in the file. (Often, screen captures unavoidably contain extraneous parts of the user’s dialog prior to or after the export.) To export your data to a file, at the “DEVICE:” prompt, send your export output to an HFS-type device.

The system administrators should be able to help you, if you are *not* sure how to use HFS devices.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/029.png) REF: The *Kernel 8.0 Systems Management: Device Handler User Guide* also describes how to send output to Host files, including how to set up and use HFS-type devices.

When a Host file is created, you *must* move that ASCII file to the computer on which the importing application resides. A file transfer protocol (e.g., KERMIT or XMODEM) can be used to move this file.

The export can be queued, if it is *not* sent to the screen. Queuing the export is *recommended* for large files and for complex sorts of the data.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/030.png) NOTE:On HFS Device Setup on OpenVMS Systems: DSM for OpenVMS requires that you add a command parameter to the OPEN command, if you export records longer than 512 characters to a Host file. The parameter is RECORDSIZE=*nnnn*, where “*nnnn*” is greater than the longest record that you are exporting. If you are using Kernel’s DEVICE (#3.5) file, the OPEN PARAMETER field for the HFS device you are using should be edited to look like “(NEW:RECORDSIZE=*nnnn*)”.

#### Sample Output

The data in <u>Figure 17</u> has been prepared for import by Lotus 1-2-3, so it need *not* be easily read by people. However, you can see that text fields are surrounded by quotes; empty text fields consist just of two quotes (“”). A space is in between each field’s value. Numeric values have no quotes. If a field defined as NUMERIC in the VA FileMan data dictionary has no value, a Zero (0) is output, because this format has SUBSTITUTE FOR NULL set to 0 (Zero).

<span id="_Ref504541783" class="anchor"></span>Figure 17: Import and Export Tools—Example of Exported Data

"FMPATIENT,FIVE" "m" "PROTE" "GANGRENE" 45

"FMPATIENT,SIX" "f" "CATHO" "SLEEPING SICKNESS" 28

"FMPATIENT,SEVEN" "m" "PROTE" "CIRRHOSIS" 25

"FMPATIENT,NINE" "m" "" "FLU" 0

"FMPATIENT,EIGHT" "f" "OTHER" "FLU" 46

"FMPATIENT,EIGHT" "f" "OTHER" "APPENDICITIS" 39

#### Special Considerations: Exporting Numbers

If a number comes from a field in your primary file that is defined as NUMERIC or COMPUTED, that number is exported with all leading spaces or trailing insignificant Zeroes removed. This is different from the way that the regular VA FileMan Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option works. If the field had a value of Zero, the character Zero (0) is exported. If the value of a numeric field in the primary file is NULL, the exported value depends on the contents of the SUBSTITUTE FOR NULL field for the format being used.

If a number comes from a source other than a DATA TYPE field of NUMERIC or COMPUTED in the primary file, it can be output with leading spaces or trailing insignificant Zeroes. Such a number might originate from a field in a pointed-to file reached by the relational syntax, a VA FileMan function, or other computed expression. In these cases, the value of the SUBSTITUTE FOR NULL field usually has no effect on what is exported.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/031.png) NOTE: Whether exported numbers have leading spaces or trailing insignificant Zeroes and whether NULLs produce special output is controlled by how the field is defined in the VA FileMan data dictionary. The DATA TYPE field input by the user when the PROMPT FOR DATA TYPE? field contains YES does *not* affect these characteristics of the export.

#### Special Considerations: Multiples

#### Exporting Data from Multiples

#### Data Flattening

Data exported from Multiples is “flattened” (i.e., data at upper levels is repeated for each subentry). For example, take the comma-delimited export for a top-level file’s \#.01 NAME field and a Subfile’s \#.01 DATE and \#1 TYPE fields. The output for an entry with four subentries would look like <u>Figure 18</u>:

<span id="_Ref462325620" class="anchor"></span>Figure 18: Import and Export Tools—Example of Data Flattening When Exporting Data from Multiples

FMPATIENT,01-JAN-95,SC

FMPATIENT,24-JUN-95,NSC

FMPATIENT,14-AUG-95,SC

FMPATIENT,21-JUL-96,NSC

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/032.png) NOTE: The top-level .01 field is repeated for each Subfile entry.

#### No More Than One Multiple at Any One File Level

You *cannot* export *more than one* Multiple at *any one file level*. You can export data from one Multiple and from Subfiles directly descendent from that Multiple (if you never export more than one Subfile at the same level). Suppose you are exporting data from a file with the structure shown in <u>Figure 19</u>:

<span id="_Ref389633121" class="anchor"></span>Figure 19: Import and Export Tools—Example of a File Structure

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/033.png)

In addition to fields in the Primary file, you can export from Subfile 1A *or* Subfile 2A, but *not* from both. Also, you can export from Subfile 2A, Subfile 2B-1, and Subfile 2C-1, but you could *not* additionally choose fields in Subfile 2B-2. If you need data from Subfiles that are *not* directly descendent from each other, you can do multiple exports and “join” the data together in the importing application.

#### Sorting with Multiples

A special, automated sort is done to the data when Multiples are exported; you *cannot* perform your own sort. When Subfiles are involved, the Export Tool performs a special sort to format the data. Since the Export Tool *must* do this customized sort, you *cannot* sort the data yourself. If you need the data in a particular sequence, sort it in the importing application. You can perform any search on the data that is necessary to choose entries for export.

#### About EXPORT Templates

The Export Tool uses two types of templates:

- EXPORT FIELDS template (created in Step 2)
- EXPORT template (created in Step 3).

These templates are variations on standard PRINT templates. They are stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file and are sometimes referred to as PRINT templates in the user dialog. Although like PRINT templates, they do differ in important respects. For example, you *cannot compile* either of the Export Tool’s templates.

You can delete these templates as soon as they are used if you wish. Also, both kinds of templates can be deleted using the Template Edit \[DITEMP\] option on the Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu. In addition, you can delete an EXPORT FIELDS template by choosing the template within the Select Fields for Export \[DDXP SELECT EXPORT FIELDS\] option, editing it, and putting an at-sign (@) at the “NAME:” prompt. Do *not* delete an EXPORT template *before* a queued export has been completed.

### How to Import Data

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The menu in <u>Figure 20</u> shows the Import Data \[DDMP IMPORT\] option used to import data, which is located under the Other Options \[DIOTHER\] menu:

<span id="_Ref447007539" class="anchor"></span>Figure 20: Import and Export Tools—Import Data Option

VA FileMan ... \[DIUSER\]

Other Options ... \[DIOTHER\]

Import Data \[DDMP IMPORT\]

The Import Tool lets you import records stored in an ASCII data file into a VA FileMan file.

The Import Tool imports records from an ASCII data file by *adding* them as new records to the VA FileMan file in question. Existing records in the destination VA FileMan file are *never* edited or updated, and the Import Tool does *not* prevent duplicate records from being added.

Importing data records from an ASCII file is a four-step process, as described below.

#### Generate ASCII Source File

Generate your source file (from your non-VA FileMan application), containing the records to be imported. Generate the file with one record per line, with the fields in each record being set off using either the delimited or fixed-length method. The last record in the file *must* be terminated with the appropriate EOL (End-of-Line) characters for your operating system.

Once you generate your ASCII source file, you need to move it to a disk that is accessible from the computer system running VA FileMan. System administrators should be able to assist you with this.

#### Specify Data Format, Source File, and Destination File

Invoke VA FileMan’s Import Data \[DDMP IMPORT\] option. It loads a two-page ScreenMan form. On page one of the form, you need to specify the: data format, source file, and destination file for your import.

- DATA FORMAT—INTERNAL or EXTERNAL: Specify if the incoming data is in external form (the way VA FileMan would display it) or internal form (the way VA FileMan would store it). Unless you are knowledgeable about how VA FileMan stores data, you should choose EXTERNAL. Also, the incoming data is only validated by VA FileMan if you choose EXTERNAL (validation prevents you from putting invalid data into the file).
- FOREIGN FORMAT: Choose a Foreign Format entry whose settings match the ASCII format for the incoming records. The only settings used from the Foreign Format entry are
- Record Delimiter
- Record Length Fixed?
- Quote Non-numeric Fields?

Make sure the settings in the Foreign Format match the format of your incoming data. Because some foreign applications export data in a different format than they import it, a Foreign Format that works for export may *not* have the appropriate settings for import.

As an alternative to specifying a Foreign Format entry, you can manually specify the settings for your incoming data in the three provided fields:

1\. Is the data fixed length?

2\. If not, what is the field delimiter?

3\. Are fields quoted?

- SOURCE FILE: Enter the path and name of your source file (the file containing the records to import).
- VA FILEMAN FILE: Specify the destination file for the imported records.
- FIELD SELECTION PAGE/IMPORT TEMPLATE: This is where you match the fields in the incoming records to the fields in the destination file. If you do *not* have an existing IMPORT template that matches incoming to destination fields, go to the Field Selection page and specify those fields individually (see the “<u>Match Source to Destination Fields</u>” section).

A completed page one of the form might look like <u>Figure 21</u>:

#### Match Source to Destination Fields

For your import, you need to match each field in the incoming record to a field in the destination VA FileMan file.

Fields in the incoming record are imported in order, from left to right. Thus, for each field in the incoming record, you specify the corresponding destination field in the VA FileMan file, in the same order. The first VA FileMan field you specify is the destination for the first field in the incoming record, the second matches the second field in the incoming record, and so forth.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

COMMAND: Press \<PF1\>H for help Insert

Remember that you *must* include the .01 field, and any fields that are required identifiers for the top-level of the file. The same is true for any Subfiles (Multiples).

If you specified a fixed-length (as opposed to delimited) data format for the incoming records, you *must* enter *not* only the destination VA FileMan field, but also the length for each corresponding incoming field.

Each time you enter a field at the “Field:” prompt, it’s added to the bottom of the list of fields displayed on the form. This shows you the destination fields you have selected, and their order. If you make a mistake, you can delete fields from the bottom of the list, one-by-one, by entering YES at the “Delete last field selected?” prompt. To insert a field, delete back to the insertion point, enter the new field, and then re-enter the deleted fields.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/034.png) REF: There are special issues when importing data into fields in Multiples; see the “<u>Special Considerations: Multiples</u>” section.

You can save the information you specify on the Field Selection page in an IMPORT template. This lets you reuse the field matching criteria you have entered for subsequent imports that use the same file and fields, without having to re-enter it. To save your field specifications as an IMPORT template, enter YES at the “Do you want to store the selected fields in an Import Template?” prompt, which you are asked after you exit the Import form (see the “<u>Run the Import</u>” section). Then, for future imports, simply enter the name of the IMPORT template on Page 1 of the Import form. You can use any IMPORT template to which your VA FileMan Access Code gives you access.

#### Run the Import

Once you have set up your data format, source file, and destination file, and matched source to destination fields, exit the Import form (press \<PF1\>E). After you exit the form, you are asked a series of questions:

1.  Do you want to store the selected fields in an Import Template?
5.  Do you want to proceed with the import?
6.  Device for Import Results Report

Storing your file and field specifications in an IMPORT template lets you do subsequent imports *without* having to re-enter all field information.

If you proceed with the import, enter a device to which the Import Results report should print. You can run the Import directly or queue it.

As the import proceeds, if an error occurs updating a field in a particular record, the record is *not* added, and an error message is added to the Import Report saying what the problem was.

An example of the dialog after exiting the Import form is shown in <u>Figure 23</u>:

<span id="_Ref462325498" class="anchor"></span>Figure 23: Import and Export Tools—Exiting the Template Form and Performing the Import

Once the import finishes, you can review the Import Results report. It lists:

- The criteria you chose for your import.
- Any records for which the import failed.
- The internal entry numbers of the first and last records imported.

In this example (<u>Figure 24</u>), six records were added, and one record was *not* added. The record that was *not* added was the fourth record in the source file. It failed due to the misspelled value “Illlinois” being rejected by the STATE field in the NEW PERSON (#200) file.

#### Special Considerations: Multiples

#### Importing Data into Multiples

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/035.png) CAUTION: Incoming Data Should *not* be flattened.

The Import Tool expects that any data bound for a Multiple be contained in the same import record (line of data) as the data for the top file level. This is different from the output of the Export Tool, which “flattens” exported data from Multiples into separate lines of output.

For example, consider a comma-delimited import of records, each including a name plus four subentries. Each subentry contains a DATE and a TYPE. The records are imported into a file with a top-level NAME (#.01) field and a Multiple with DATE (#.01) field and TYPE (#1) field. For this import, you would choose the destination fields as shown in <u>Figure 25</u>:

New subentries need to be added to every Subfile on a path to the lowest level Subfiles. Your data *must* include values for the .01 field and all the required identifiers for every Subfile (as well as for the top-level of the file). You can add more than one subentry in a particular Subfile. However, you are restricted to the same set of fields for every entry in each Subfile.

#### Importing from VMS Files

When importing from a data file that’s been transferred to a VMS-based computer system, a problem can occur if, once transferred, the data file does *not* get a maximum record length stored in its file header. This can happen when a DOS file is moved to a VMS system by some protocols. When the maximum record length is unknown, VMS uses a default maximum size of 510. If the length of a data record in the source file is larger than the maximum size, an error results.

The solution is to run the VMS CONVERT utility on the Host file. This utility adds the maximum record information to the file header and everything works just fine!

You can see if the maximum record length is stored in a file’s header on a VMS system, by using DCL command in <u>Figure 27</u>:

### Foreign Formats

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### FOREIGN FORMAT File Attributes Reference

The following fields in the FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) File correspond to attributes of the formatted data that you wish to export or import:

- FIELD DELIMITER
- QUOTE NON-NUMERIC FIELDS?
- SEND LAST FIELD DELIMITER?
- PROMPT FOR DATA TYPE?
- RECORD DELIMITER
- SUBSTITUTE FOR NULL
- RECORD LENGTH FIXED?
- DATE FORMAT
- MAXIMUM OUTPUT LENGTH
- FILE HEADER
- NEED FOREIGN FIELD NAMES?
- FILE TRAILER

When *exporting* records, all fields in this file are used in the export process. When *importing* records, only three fields are used in the import process:

- FIELD DELIMITER
- RECORD LENGTH FIXED?
- QUOTE NON-NUMERIC FIELDS?

In this section, each format characteristic is described. Some combinations of characteristics are unacceptable; these situations are mentioned.

Also, some of the fields allow you to enter M code.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/037.png) REF: Export-specific variables you can use in this M code are described in the “<u>Variables Available for Developer Use</u>” section.

To set up a FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file entry, use the Define Foreign File Format \[DDXP DEFINE FORMAT\] option to print out a format, use the Print Format Documentation \[DDXP FORMAT DOCUMENTATION\] option.

#### FIELD DELIMITER

Many applications can import and export data if the values of fields in each record are separated by a known character or sequence of characters. The application puts (or expects) data before the first delimiter into its first field, between the first and second delimiter into the second field, and so on. Therefore, the ability to specify and recognize these field delimiters is a crucial aspect of many data exchanges.

The Import and Export Tools’ FIELD DELIMITER fields allow you to specify up to 15 characters to be placed between each field. You can directly enter any string of characters except ones that begin with a number or consist of characters that have special meaning when editing VA FileMan data (e.g., ^ or @).

If your field delimiter begins with one of these restricted characters or consists of an unprintable control character (like \<TAB\>), you can enter the ASCII-value of the delimiter. When entering the ASCII values, always use three digits. Thus, \<TAB\> (ASCII 9) becomes “009” and @ (ASCII 64) becomes “064”. You can enter up to four ASCII values. If more than one is needed, separate the values with commas (e.g., “048,094”).

If you want the user to be prompted for a field delimiter at the time the EXPORT template is being created, enter “ASK” in this field.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/038.png) CAUTION: Using unprintable control characters (ASCII values less than 32) as delimiters may not have the effect you want. During either export or import, often control characters are intercepted by terminal software, communication programs, or network links; they may not be passed through unaltered as regular printable characters usually are. For example, ASCII value 5 is interpreted by many terminals as a request for their Answerback Message. Thus, putting “005” in the FIELD DELIMITER field might cause an Answerback Message to be returned by your terminal instead of the ASCII value 5 being inserted between field values.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/039.png) NOTE: The importing application will find the delimiting character, if it occurs in the data. This causes an incorrect determination of the boundary between fields. For example, if a comma (,) is the field delimiter and the data for a field was FMPATIENT,10, the importing application would put FMPATIENT into the first field and 10 into the second field. You can avoid this problem by specifying that data in *non*-numeric fields be surrounded by quotes (e.g., “FMPATIENT,10”). Most importing applications ignore delimiters, if they occur within a quoted string.  
  
REF: For more information on *non*-numeric fields, see the “<u>QUOTE NON-NUMERIC FIELDS?</u>” section.

#### SEND LAST FIELD DELIMITER?

Some importing applications expect a field delimiter following every field, including the final field in a record. Other applications only expect delimiters between fields; nothing follows the final field. This field allows you to specify whether a field delimiter should be exported after the last field. A YES answer sends the delimiter, a NO answer does *not*.

The contents of this field does *not* affect whether a delimiter is sent after each *record*.

#### RECORD DELIMITER

Applications that import delimited fields need to know when one record ends and a new one begins. In most cases, records are separated by a carriage return (or by a line feed and a carriage return). This is the same as pressing Enter at the end of a line. The Export Tool *automatically* puts this separator after each record; every record begins on a new line of output. You do *not* need to put the ASCII values for carriage return and line feed in this field.

Some applications may also require that additional characters be placed after each record. If this is the case, put those characters into the RECORD DELIMITER field. The requirements for coding the field are the same as for the FIELD DELIMITER field.

#### RECORD LENGTH FIXED?

A second common way to import and export data (in addition to using delimited data) is with fixed length records. In a fixed length record, each field has a predetermined, constant data length. For example, a name field might be 30 characters long. The name “FMPATNT,10” is only 10 characters long; thus, 20 spaces would be added to the field value to fill the required 30 characters. The next field’s value would begin in the thirty-first column.

If you want to import or export fixed length records, answer YES to this field. At the time that the EXPORT template is created (or an import is done), the user is prompted for the length of each field in the target or source file.

During export, in most cases data is truncated when the length of a field is reached. Thus, if a field contains 32 characters but the user-defined length is 30, the last 2 characters are *not* exported. However, DATE/TIME-valued fields are always exported in their entirety. For dates, the user *must* indicate a data length at least as long as the exported date, which is 11 characters for standard VA FileMan dates.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/040.png) NOTE: Fixed record lengths *cannot* be used in conjunction with field delimited data. Also, the maximum record size for exports for a fixed length format is 255 characters. There is no limit on record length during import, however.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/041.png) CAUTION: Fixed length exports succeed only if all fields are exported on the same physical line. Therefore, the total of all the field lengths *must not* be more than the value stored in the MAXIMUM OUTPUT LENGTH field.

#### MAXIMUM OUTPUT LENGTH

In many cases, data import is much easier if an entire record is contained on a single “line” of output; there are no carriage returns within a single record, only between records. (This is a requirement for a successful fixed length export.)

In a regular VA FileMan print, the amount of data printed before a carriage return is dependent on the type of device being used for output (i.e., a CRT screen would normally have 80 characters on a line, a printer 80 or 132). For data export, however, the physical characteristics of the output device are *not* controlling. Rather, the capabilities of the application importing data are overriding. Therefore, you can use the MAXIMUM OUTPUT LENGTH field to specify the length of a physical record. For field delimited (as opposed to fixed length) exports, this record length can be larger than the traditional M data limit of 255 characters.

Put a number from 0 through 9999 into this field. The default record length is 80. If you want the user to be prompted for a record length at the time that an EXPORT template is being created, put 0 (Zero) into this field.

Regardless of the length of the maximum record, a carriage return is written after each record is output.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/042.png) NOTE: The length of a record *cannot* exceed 255 characters when using a fixed length format.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/043.png) CAUTION: When sending exports to a Host file on a DSM for OpenVMS (e.g., VAX) system, you *must* add a parameter to the OPEN command, if any of your exported records are longer than 512 characters. See the “<u>How to Export Data</u>” section for details.

#### NEED FOREIGN FIELD NAMES?

If this field is answered YES, the user is prompted for a field name for each exported field when the EXPORT template is created. The field names are stored in the NAME OF FOREIGN FIELD field in the EXPORT FIELD Multiple in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/044.png) REF: For one way to use this information, see the discussion in the “<u>FILE HEADER</u>” section.

#### QUOTE NON-NUMERIC FIELDS?

When *importing* data, VA FileMan ignores the field delimiter in a quoted string when this field is set to YES.

When *exporting* data, if you want all values that do *not* belong to a DATA TYPE field of NUMERIC to be surrounded by quotation marks, answer YES to this field.

Many importing applications treat data within quotation marks (“) in a special way. Sometimes such data is automatically considered to be text, as opposed to numbers. Also, the importer may ignore the field delimiter character, if it falls within a quoted string. Quoting a NULL value from a *non*-numeric field results in two double quotes (“”) being exported.

During export, the DATA TYPE field value is automatically determined for fields in the primary file and its Multiples. DATA TYPE fields of NUMERIC are considered NUMERIC. There may be other fields that you want treated as NUMERIC. For example:

- COMPUTED-type fields with numeric results.
- Fields referenced by the extended pointer syntax.
- Replies to the “EXPORT FIELD:” prompt that are computed expressions with numeric results.

By default, these fields are assigned a FREE TEXT DATA TYPE. If you want the user to choose the DATA TYPE when the EXPORT template is created, answer YES to the PROMPT FOR DATA TYPE? field.

If the Export Tool assigns a *non*-numeric to a DATA TYPE field or if the user chooses one of those DATA TYPE field values, the field’s values is surrounded by quotes when this field contains YES.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/045.png) NOTE: Do *not* set this field to YES if a fixed length record is being exported or imported.

#### PROMPT FOR DATA TYPE?

The Export Tool determines the DATA TYPE field value for fields in the primary file and its Multiples based on their definition in the data dictionary. Other fields are automatically assigned a DATA TYPE of FREE TEXT. If you want the user to choose the DATA TYPE of each field when creating an EXPORT template, answer YES to this field. The only DATA TYPE field values recognized by the Export Tool are the following:

- FREE TEXT
- NUMERIC
- DATE/TIME

The DATA TYPE field value entered by the user controls whether the values from that field are surrounded by quotes if the QUOTE NON-NUMERIC FIELDS? field is set to YES. The user supplied DATA TYPE field value does *not* affect how numbers are exported; numeric export is controlled by the DATA TYPE field value in the data dictionary only.

#### SUBSTITUTE FOR NULL

NUMERIC fields with no data (a NULL value) results by default in nothing being exported for that field. For fixed record length exports, this should *not* be a problem. However, if your importing application uses spaces as a delimiter, you may need a printable character to be exported for NULL-valued NUMERIC fields. If you want a character or characters (such as “0” or “.”) substituted for numeric NULLs, put them into this field. NULL values for DATA TYPE field values of NUMERIC in the primary file (including its Multiples) have this character exported. If you want quotes (‘‘) in your substitute string, enter two quote marks (“”) for each quote you want.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/046.png) NOTE: Do *not* put anything in this field when defining a fixed length format.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/047.png) CAUTION: There are no substitutions for NULL values if the field being exported is *not* in the primary file, if it is reached using relational navigation.

#### DATE FORMAT

The native, or default, format for dates varies from application to application. VA FileMan uses two formats:

- Internal or Storage format:

*YYYMMDD*

Where *YYY* is the year minus 1700.

- External or Default display format:

*MON DD,YYYY*

When data from a DATA TYPE field of DATE/TIME is exported, it is in the external format.

Since the importing application may recognize a different format, you can change the exported value by placing M code in this field (only those with Programmer access can enter code in this field.) When this M code is executed, the local variable X contains the date in VA FileMan *internal* format. Your M code should result in the local variable Y containing the date in the format you want exported.

If your format is used with Kernel, it is *recommended* that you make use of the date extrinsic functions provided by Kernel, if possible.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/048.png) REF: For more information on Kernel date extrinsic functions, see the *Kernel 8.0 and Kernel Toolkit 7.3 Developer’s Guide*.

Data from fields with DATA TYPE field values of DATE/TIME in the primary file, its Multiples and pointed-to files are altered by the code in this field; date values from other sources are *not*. There is another way to change the exported output; you can use a VA FileMan function when selecting fields for export:

<span id="_Toc342980629" class="anchor"></span>Figure 28: Import and Export Tools—Using VA FileMan Functions When Exporting Data

THEN EXPORT FIELD: <span class="mark">NUMDATE(DATE OF BIRTH)</span>

The DATE FORMAT field has no effect on that output.

#### FILE HEADER

Some applications require special information to process the data in the file that is imported. For example, field names might be needed. Also, you can put some special data into the file for identification or documentation purposes.

The FILE HEADER field allows you to output information before the stream of exported data. This field can contain either a literal string surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., “Data for Lotus 1-2-3”) or M code that, when executed, writes the desired output.

You can put M code here only if you have Programmer access. The local DDXPXTNO variable, which equals the internal entry number in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file of the EXPORT template being used for data output, is defined when the code is executed. You can use this variable to access information about the export. The data type, length, and foreign field name are stored in the EXPORT FIELD (#100) Multiple field.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/049.png) REF: For additional information, see the data dictionary for the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file.

#### FILE TRAILER

You can use this field like the FILE HEADER field. The literal or M code is output *after* the exported data.

#### Variables Available for Developer Use

Some of the fields in the FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file allow you to enter M code, if you have Programmer access. You can use data stored in the EXPORT template entry at the time the export is performed. You can also access information in the FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file entry used for the export.

Two variables are available for use in the M code entered in the FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file fields:

- DDXPXTNO—Internal entry number of the EXPORT template in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file.
- DDXPFFNO—Internal entry number of the Foreign Format in the FOREIGN FORMAT (#.44) file.

Consult the data dictionaries of the two files for fields that can contain useful information about either the format or the specific export itself. The EXPORT FIELD (#100) Multiple field in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file might be of particular interest. This Multiple contains information about each field being exported.

All exports depend on a Foreign Format. In addition, you can use Foreign Formats for imports as well. Usually, you can use an existing format to properly format your data for export or import.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/050.png) REF: To find out what formats exist on your system, see the “<u>Print Format Documentation Option</u>” section.

If no existing format meets your needs, use the Define Foreign File Format \[DDXP DEFINE FORMAT\] option to create a new one. You can use the Define Foreign File Format \[DDXP DEFINE FORMAT\] option to:

- Define a new Foreign Format from scratch.
- Modify a Foreign Format that has *not* been used to create an EXPORT template.
- Copy an existing format to create a similar, modified one.

If you are using the Export Tool through Kernel’s menu system, you need the DDXP-DEFINE security key to use the Define Foreign File Format \[DDXP DEFINE FORMAT\] option.

<u>Figure 32</u> is an example of making a new format from an existing one.

The Define Foreign File Format \[DDXP DEFINE FORMAT\] option is the first option on the Data Export to Foreign Format \[DDXP EXPORT MENU\] menu, which is located under the Other Options \[DIOTHER\] menu:

# Relational Navigation

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Relational navigation gives you a way to reach beyond the current file to reference fields within other files.

Suppose, for example, you are doing a printout from the PATIENT (#2) file. In the PATIENT (#2) file, there is a pointer to the (fictitious) DOCTOR file. This links a given patient to a given doctor. But the only information about the doctor available from the point of view of the PATIENT (#2) file is the doctor’s name. What if, in your printout, you want to print the doctor’s name, phone number, and specialty (where phone number and specialty are fields in the \[fictitious\] DOCTOR file)?

The answer is to use relational navigation. By using the pointer relationship between the PATIENT and the (fictitious) DOCTOR file, you can start from the PATIENT (#2) file, and for each record in the PATIENT (#2) file, retrieve not only the name of the doctor for that patient, but also additional information about the doctor from the (fictitious) DOCTOR file.

<span id="_Toc203326908" class="anchor"></span>Figure 38: Relational Navigation—Example Illustrating Relational Navigation

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/054.png)

You can use relational navigation in many places in VA FileMan to *move beyond the current file* and retrieve or edit information in related files’ records, including:

- Reports (Print Fields, Sort Criteria, Search Criteria)
- Editing Records (edit information in related files, *not* just current file)
- Computed Expressions
- COMPUTED Fields
- Within word-processing \|Windows\|

The syntax to perform relational navigation, called Extended Pointer syntax, is discussed throughout this section.

Several types of pointer relationships between files can be exploited to combine information:

- <u>Simple Extended Pointer</u> (most common)
- <u>Backward Extended Pointer</u>
- <u>Join Extended Pointer</u>

A special form of relational navigation, called relational jumping, uses these pointer relationships to let you “jump” from one file to another. This makes it easier to specify a group of fields from another file when specifying what fields to edit, search, print, or sort by in interactive VA FileMan.

## Simple Extended Pointer

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The most common form of relational navigation uses *simple extended pointers*. This type of navigation requires a pointer field to exist from the current file to another file. Using a pointer field from an entry in the current file, you can easily retrieve information from the pointed-to entry in another file.

For example, suppose you are printing a report from the PATIENT (#2) file. Further suppose that the PATIENT (#2) file has a pointer field called ATTENDING PHYSICIAN field to the (fictitious) DOCTOR file. Now, what if you wanted to include the phone number of the attending physician for each patient in your report from the PATIENT file? The attending physician’s phone number is stored in the (fictitious) DOCTOR file, *not* the PATIENT file.

You can include the attending physician’s phone number for each patient in your report, by using a simple extended pointer at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompt:

<span id="_Toc342980640" class="anchor"></span>Figure 39: Relational Navigation—Example of a Simple Extended Pointer

PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:PHONE NUMBER</span>

You can use simple extended pointers in many places in VA FileMan, including:

- Reports (Print Fields, Sort Criteria, Search Criteria)
- Editing Records (edit information in related files, *not* just current file)
- Computed Expressions
- COMPUTED Fields
- Within word-processing \|Windows\|

The syntax for simple extended pointers is described below.

### Simple Extended Pointer Syntax (Short form)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

With simple extended pointers, there *must* be an existing relationship based on a pointer field from the current file to the file you are interested in. In this case, you can reference a field in a pointed-to entry by using the following syntax:

pfield:element

- “pfield” is the name (or number, preceded by \#) of a pointer field in the current file.
- “element” is an element that exists in the field to which pfield points.

This is called the short form of extended pointer syntax.

For example, since ATTENDING PHYSICIAN is a pointer field in the current file to the (fictitious) DOCTOR file, the short form of extended pointer syntax to reference the PHONE NUMBER field in the (fictitious) DOCTOR file would be:

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:PHONE NUMBER

### Simple Extended Pointer Syntax (Long Form)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The most complete or general form of extended pointer syntax (also called long form) is shown below:

expr:file:element

OR

expr IN file FILE:element

“Expr” is any expression that applies to the file that is your current context. “File” is the name of any file. “Element” is any element (field) in the file named by “File”.

For example, since ATTENDING PHYSICIAN is a pointer field in the current file to the (fictitious) DOCTOR file, the long form of extended pointer syntax to reference the PHONE NUMBER field in the (fictitious) DOCTOR file would be:

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:DOCTOR:PHONE NUMBER

OR

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN IN file DOCTOR:PHONE NUMBER

### Examples

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Relational Query Example

You can use simple extended pointers to make relational queries. For example, suppose you want to print all patients who are older than their attending physicians. A field in the PATIENT file called ATTENDING PHYSICIAN points to the (fictitious) DOCTOR file. Given a field PT AGE in the PATIENT file and a field DR AGE in the (fictitious) DOCTOR file, you can use the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option and then enter the information shown in <u>Figure 40</u>:

<span id="_Ref462325096" class="anchor"></span>Figure 40: Relational Navigation—Example of a Relational Query

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

SORT BY: NAME// <span class="mark">PT AGE\> (ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:DR AGE)</span>

WITHIN PT AGE\>(ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:DR AGE), SORT BY: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME</span>

Here, the simple extended pointer (ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:DR AGE) is used to make a comparison between values in fields in two different files.

#### COMPUTED Field Example

Suppose the PATIENT file has an ATTENDING PHYSICIAN field that points to the (fictitious) DOCTOR file. The (fictitious) DOCTOR file, in turn, has a field called SPECIALTY. If you want to create a COMPUTED field within the PATIENT (#2) file data dictionary that is equivalent to the SPECIALTY field in the (fictitious) DOCTOR file, you can define a COMPUTED field as:

<span id="_Toc342980642" class="anchor"></span>Figure 41: Relational Navigation—Example of the Short Form Extended Pointer Syntax

'COMPUTED-FIELD' EXPRESSION: <span class="mark">ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:SPECIALTY</span>

The file does *not* have to be specified in this case, since there is a direct link between the two files through the pointer field. This is an example of the *short form* of the simple extended pointer syntax.

An equivalent computed expression that explicitly identifies the file is: ATTENDING PHYSICIAN IN DOCTOR FILE:SPECIALTY. This is the *long form* of the syntax. It is “long” because the file name is included.

### How to Navigate With a Variable Pointer Field

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If the pointing field is a VARIABLE POINTER, the long form of the extended pointer syntax *must* be used so that VA FileMan knows which of the pointed-to files to search. Here is the syntax:

vpfield IN file FILE:element

OR

vpfield:file:element

“Vpfield” is the VARIABLE POINTER field in the current file, “file” is one of the possible pointed-to files, and “element” applies to that pointed-to file.

<u>Figure 42</u> is an example from the PATIENT (#2) file where the PROVIDER field is a VARIABLE POINTER to either the (fictitious) PHYSICIAN file or the (fictitious) PERSON file, and PHONE is a field in the (fictitious) PERSON file. You could enter the print specifications shown in <u>Figure 42</u>:

<span id="_Ref389629668" class="anchor"></span>Figure 42: Relational Navigation—Entering Print Specifications and Including Fields in Pointed-To Files

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">PROVIDER</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">FILE(PROVIDER)</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">PROVIDER:PERSON:PHONE</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

You receive the output shown in <u>Figure 43</u>:

<span id="_Ref389633231" class="anchor"></span>Figure 43: Relational Navigation—Example of Output that Includes Fields from Pointed-To Files

NAME PROVIDER FILE(PROVIDER) PROVIDER:PERSON:PHONE

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

FMPATIENT,13 FMPROVIDER,3 PHYSICIAN

FMPATIENT,14 FMPROVIDER,4 PERSON 555-3332

The long form simple pointer asked for the PHONE field from the PERSON file. Only the VARIABLE POINTER from the FMPATIENT,14 entry pointed to the (fictitious) PERSON file. Thus, only his phone number is displayed.

## Relational Jumps across Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In interactive VA FileMan mode, you can use the following syntax:

file:

This syntax changes your context to the file you specify; you “jump” to the specified file. You can then select fields from the file to which you have jumped. You can only do this in four places in VA FileMan:

- “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompt (Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option)
- “SEARCH FOR FIELD:” prompt (Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] option)
- “SORT BY:” prompt (Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] and Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options)
- “PRINT FIELD:” prompt (Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] and Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options)

Relational jumping is mainly a convenience to make it easier to select more than one field from another file. By letting you temporarily “jump” to the other file, it’s easier to pick all the fields you want directly, rather than having to use extended pointer syntax to specify each field.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/055.png) NOTE: When sorting, printing, searching, or editing, if you want to reference several fields from another file, it is more efficient to jump to the file and specify the needed fields than it is to use the extended pointer syntax to reference the fields one at a time. Multiple uses of the extended pointer cause multiple relational jumps.

<u>Table 4</u> lists the four types of relational jumps that correspond to the four extended pointer syntax:

| Type                    | Example                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Simple (short form) | ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:     |
| Simple (long form)  | PROVIDER IN PERSON FILE: |
| Backward            | RADIOLOGY EXAM:          |
| Join                | PAYSCALE IN FACTOR FILE: |

<span id="_Ref386465948" class="anchor"></span>Table 5: Advanced Edit Techniques—Edit Qualifiers

Within the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option, for example, you can respond to the prompts as depicted in the dialog that follows:

<span id="_Toc342980646" class="anchor"></span>Figure 44: Relational Navigation—Using Relational Jumps with the Enter or Edit File Entries Option

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <span class="mark">NAME</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:</span>

EDIT WHICH DOCTOR FIELD: ALL// <span class="mark">NAME;"PHYSICIAN NAME"</span>

THEN EDIT DOCTOR FIELD: <span class="mark">NICKNAME</span>

THEN EDIT DOCTOR FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Because of a pointer linkage between the ATTENDING PHYSICIAN field in the PATIENT (#2) file and the (fictitious) DOCTOR file, you can use the simple, short form of the extended pointer to navigate to the (fictitious) DOCTOR file. Then, during an interactive editing session you can specify the fields you want to edit for each patient. In this case, after you edit the patient’s name, you can edit that patient’s physician’s name and nickname.

## Backward Extended Pointer

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Simple extended pointers let you retrieve information from an entry in another file that the current entry explicitly points to through a POINTER TO A FILE field. What if you wanted to go the other way—retrieve information from an entry in another file that points to (*not from*) the current entry?

<span id="_Ref343503121" class="anchor"></span>Figure 45: Relational Navigation—Example Illustrating a File with Pointers to another File

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/056.png)

Suppose you have selected the PATIENT (#2) file, and you want to list dates of radiology exams for certain patients. If the pointer is from the RADIOLOGY EXAM file to the PATIENT file (*not from*), you can list the radiology exam dates using a Backward Extended Pointer.

In the file that contains the POINTER TO A FILE field, one of the following three conditions *must* be true:

1.  Either a New-Style or Traditional cross-reference on the field exists. If the POINTER TO A FILE field is in a subfile Multiple, the whole file *must* be cross-referenced. Compound cross-references can be used if the first subscript in the cross-reference is the pointer value with no transforms. The use of a compound cross-reference can result in “navigation” to only a subset of the pointing entries. Even though a record can have a valid POINTER TO A FILE field, unless all the other fields that make up subscripts on the compound index are also *non*-NULL, there is no entry in the index for that record.
7.  The .001 field of the file is the pointing field.
8.  The .01 field of the pointing file is the pointing field, and there is a “DINUM” condition on the field.

To use a , you *must* make a relational jump from the current file to the file in question (enter the name of the file pointing to the current file, followed by a colon). Once you make the relational jump to the backwards-pointer-linked file, specify which fields/elements to access in that file.

Returning to the situation mentioned above, within the RADIOLOGY EXAM file there is a field called EXAMINEE pointing back to the PATIENT (#2) file. That EXAMINEE pointer field is cross-referenced. You want to list the EXAM DATE field from the RADIOLOGY EXAM file entries that point back to a patient. From the PATIENT (#2) file, enter:

<span id="_Toc342980648" class="anchor"></span>Figure 46: Relational Navigation—Example Using a Backward Extended Pointer

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME;N;S1</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">RADIOLOGY EXAM:</span>

By 'RADIOLOGY EXAM', do you mean the RADIOLOGY EXAM File,

pointing via its 'EXAMINEE' Field? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (YES)

THEN PRINT RADIOLOGY EXAM FIELD: <span class="mark">EXAM DATE</span>

THEN PRINT RADIOLOGY EXAM FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

As indicated by this example, you did *not* have to specify the EXAMINEE field. That field was identified because it is a field in the RADIOLOGY EXAM file that points back to the current file.

<u>Figure 47</u> is the output produced by these print specifications:

<span id="_Ref389629696" class="anchor"></span>Figure 47: Relational Navigation—Example of the Output Produced after Using a Backward Extended Pointer

PATIENT LIST OCT 1,1996 15:12 PAGE 1

FMPATIENT,14

FMPATIENT,15 1995

1993

FMPATIENT,10 SEP 29,1995

JUN 22,1996

The resulting output is a two-column report containing names from the PATIENT file and corresponding examination dates from the RADIOLOGY EXAM file. Since there may be several RADIOLOGY EXAM file entries for a given patient, this report is an example of a Multiple-valued (Multiline) result being returned.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/057.png) REF: For more information on Multiline results being returned, see the “<u>Multiline Return Values</u>” section.

You can use Backwards Extended Pointers in the following places in VA FileMan:

- “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompt (Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option)
- “SEARCH FOR FIELD:” prompt (Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] option)
- “SORT BY:” prompt (Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] and Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options)
- “PRINT FIELD:” prompt (Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] and Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options)

## Join Extended Pointer

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can establish an extended pointer link even if there is no pre-existing pointer relationship between the two files. You use a value from one file to do a lookup in a second file.

Suppose you store in the (fictitious) PAY FACTOR file a list of factors for calculating taxes. Each entry in this file corresponds to a different pay scale. In the (fictitious) PERSONNEL file, you have a field called PAYSCALE. You want to retrieve the value of a field DEDUCTION in the PAY FACTOR entry that equals the PAYSCALE field for each entry in the (fictitious) PERSONNEL file. You can create a COMPUTED field expression in the (fictitious) PERSONNEL file:

<span id="_Toc342980650" class="anchor"></span>Figure 48: Relational Navigation—Using a Value from One File to Do a Lookup in a Second File

'COMPUTED-FIELD' EXPRESSION: <span class="mark">PAYSCALE IN PAY FACTOR FILE:DEDUCTION</span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/058.png) NOTE: PAYSCALE was *not* defined as pointing to the (fictitious) PAY FACTOR file. The link to that file is made by the COMPUTED field definition. PAYSCALE could itself be a COMPUTED field. In this situation, the value of the PAYSCALE field in the (fictitious) PERSONNEL file is used to do a normal lookup in the (fictitious) PAY FACTOR file using all lookup type cross-references.

In database terminology, this extended pointer capability is like a JOIN operation, because you can specify at any time a new relationship between two formerly unrelated files. Therefore, this type of pointing is called the Join Extended Pointer.

### Limitations

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If the join expression matches more than one entry in the file being joined, the first matching entry (by internal entry number) is returned as the result of the join. Thus, if your join expression is likely to match more than one entry, be aware that only the *first* matching entry is returned.

### Example

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You could find out if any entries in the PERSONNEL file could be matched against the NAME field in the PATIENT file just by specifying the sort shown in <u>Figure 49</u>:

<span id="_Ref389633266" class="anchor"></span>Figure 49: Relational Navigation—Example of Matching Entries in Two Files Using the SORT BY Field

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

SORT BY: <span class="mark">NAME IN PERSONNEL FILE</span>

The expression at the “SORT BY:” prompt selects entries in the PERSONNEL file where the value of the NAME field in the PATIENT file matches the PERSONNEL file’s .01 field. The PATIENT file’s NAME field is being used as a lookup in the PERSONNEL file. Since you are evaluating the .01 field of the PERSONNEL file, the “:element” part of the extended pointer syntax is unnecessary.

## Multiline Return Values

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you use extended pointer syntax, a lookup is performed in the navigated-to file. This lookup usually evaluates to a single value. However, in some situations, extended pointer syntax can end up returning a Multiple-valued or “Multiline” result. Multiline responses can be generated by:

- Simple Pointer to a WORD-PROCESSING Field
- Simple Pointer to a Multiple
- Backward Pointer

You *cannot* use extended pointer syntax that can evaluate to a Multiline value at VA FileMan’s “SORT BY:” and “SEARCH FOR FIELD:” prompts. Some of the ways in which you *can* use extended pointers that evaluate to a Multiline value are:

- As the definition of a COMPUTED field.
- Within word-processing \|Windows\| (so one document can call another document to print inside it).
- For input to word-processing data elements (so you can use the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option to stuff one document into another).
- As the name of a transfer document in the Line Editor’s Transfer option.
- As a Print Field: specification in the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option.
- In an INPUT template when a multi-valued field is being edited.

### WORD-PROCESSING Field

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

WORD-PROCESSING field names (or field numbers preceded with a \#) are allowed as elements in extended pointer expressions. For example, in the PATIENT (#2) file the HISTORY field is in the DIAGNOSIS Multiple. You can define this computed expression:

<span id="_Toc342980652" class="anchor"></span>Figure 50: Relational Navigation—Example of Using a WORD-PROCESSING Field in an Extended Pointer Expression

"B-12 Deficiency" IN DIAGNOSIS FILE:HISTORY

This Multiline computed expression would signify the WORD-PROCESSING HISTORY field text associated with a patient’s B-12 Deficiency DIAGNOSIS. A lookup is done on the DIAGNOSIS Multiple using “B-12 Deficiency” as the lookup value. If the patient does *not* have that DIAGNOSIS (or no HISTORY is associated with it), the value of this extended pointer expression would be NULL.

### Multiples

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use the simple pointer syntax to get data from Multiples of files pointed to by other files. The RADIOLOGY EXAM file described above points to the PATIENT (#2) file by way of the EXAMINEE field. In the PATIENT (#2) file there is a DIAGNOSIS Multiple. You could obtain a list of diagnoses associated with RADIOLOGY EXAM file entries by doing what is shown in <u>Figure 51</u>:

<span id="_Ref160528057" class="anchor"></span>Figure 51: Relational Navigation—Example of Using the Simple Pointer Syntax to Get Data from a Multiple

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">PRINT FILE ENTRIES</span>

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: RADIOLOGY EXAM// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

SORT BY: NAME// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

START WITH NAME: FIRST// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">TEST NUMBER</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">EXAMINEE:DIAGNOSIS</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

HEADING: RADIOLOGY EXAM LIST// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: <span class="mark">Exam Diagnoses</span>

For each entry in the RADIOLOGY EXAM file, EXAMINEE points to an entry in the PATIENT (#2) file. The diagnoses associated with that patient are returned as the Multiline output of the expression EXAMINEE:DIAGNOSIS.

### Backward Pointer

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Figure 52</u> shows how you can use the cross-referenced Backward Pointer that yields a Multiline response in an INPUT template:

<span id="_Ref389631047" class="anchor"></span>Figure 52: Relational Navigation—Example Using a Cross-Referenced Backward Pointer to Yield a Multiline Response: Stored in an INPUT Template

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <span class="mark">NAME</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">RADIOLOGY EXAM:</span>

By 'RADIOLOGY EXAM', do you mean the RADIOLOGY EXAM File,

pointing via its 'EXAMINEE' Field? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (YES)

WILL TERMINAL USER BE ALLOWED TO SELECT PROPER ENTRY IN 'RADIOLOGY EXAM' FILE? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (YES)

DO YOU WANT TO PERMIT ADDING A NEW 'RADIOLOGY EXAM' ENTRY? NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

EDIT WHICH RADIOLOGY EXAM FIELD: <span class="mark">DATE OF EXAM</span>

THEN EDIT WHICH RADIOLOGY EXAM FIELD: <span class="mark">RESULTS</span>

THEN EDIT WHICH RADIOLOGY EXAM FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">ATTENDING PHYSICIAN</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

STORE THESE FIELDS IN TEMPLATE: <span class="mark">PATIENT-EXAM</span>

To use this template, you do the following:

1.  Specify the patient’s name to edit.
9.  Select one of the RADIOLOGY EXAM file’s entries that point back to that patient.
10. Edit data within that selected entry in the RADIOLOGY EXAM file.
11. Return to edit another field in the PATIENT (#2) file.

A sample editing session using this INPUT template looks like this:

<span id="_Toc342980655" class="anchor"></span>Figure 53: Relational Navigation—Example Using an INPUT Template with a Cross-Referenced Backward Pointer to Yield a Multiline Response

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <span class="mark">\[PATIENT-EXAM</span>

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,11</span>

NAME: FMPATIENT,11// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Select RADIOLOGY EXAM: <span class="mark">?</span>

CHOOSE FROM:

1\. DEC 4, 1984

2\. OCT 1, 1985

CHOOSE 1-2: <span class="mark">2</span>

DATE OF EXAM: OCT 1, 1985// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

RESULTS: <span class="mark">NORMAL</span>

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: FMPATIENT// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

As indicated by this example, the only RADIOLOGY EXAM file entries you were allowed to choose were the two that pointed back to the selected patient (FMPATIENT,11).

Each file, for the purpose of this editing sequence, is considered a subfile of the original, so that when no more fields within the second file are specified, the dialog falls back to the original file. Having navigated over to a second file, you can use another extended pointer to move to still a third file.

You *cannot* cross file boundaries on input unless you have WRITE access to the file to which you move. This restriction applies to the individual who created this Patient-Exam INPUT template.

# Advanced Edit Techniques

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Field Value Stuffing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can make the editing process quicker, easier, and more accurate by “stuffing” field values, when appropriate. The amount of data that needs to be entered from the keyboard can be reduced by providing responses that can be verified by pressing the Enter key or that are automatically put into the file.

### Set Field Default (2 //)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can require a particular field to default to a certain data value by answering the “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompt with the name of the field followed with two slashes (//) and the default value.

For example, if you enter:

<span id="_Toc342980656" class="anchor"></span>Figure 54: Advanced Edit Techniques—Setting a Default Value for a Field

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">SEX//MALE</span>

In this example, every time you get to the SEX field prompt for an entry in which sex has *not* yet been recorded, MALE is prompted as the default value of the SEX field.

### Stuff/Delete Field Value (3///)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan offers a way to force a value to be inserted into the database (i.e., “stuff”), even if a different value is already on file. You simply use three slashes (“///”) instead of two:

<span id="_Toc342980657" class="anchor"></span>Figure 55: Advanced Edit Techniques—”Stuffing” a Value into a Field in the Database

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">SEX///MALE</span>

No terminal dialog occurs when such mandatory defaults are inserted.

If you want to force the value of SEX to be deleted, you should respond as follows:

<span id="_Toc342980658" class="anchor"></span>Figure 56: Advanced Edit Techniques—Deleting a Value from a Field in the Database

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">SEX///@</span>

After entering the at-sign (@), you would see the message shown in <u>Figure 57</u>:

<span id="_Ref389633307" class="anchor"></span>Figure 57: Advanced Edit Techniques—Warning Message When Deleting a Value from a Field in the Database

> **WARNING:** THIS MEANS AUTOMATIC DELETION!!

The three-slash default’s value *must* contain the external value of the field. The value is validated (using the INPUT transform) just as a user-supplied response is validated.

### Unvalidated Stuffs: (4////)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you have Programmer access, you can define a default that does *not* go through the INPUT transform by using four slashes (“////”). If you use this kind of default, you *must* show the internally stored value of the field.

For example, the SEX field has a DATA TYPE field value of SET OF CODES, where “m” stands for MALE and “f” stands for FEMALE; you could define a four-slash stuff like this:

<span id="_Toc342980660" class="anchor"></span>Figure 58: Advanced Edit Techniques—”Stuffing” Default Value into a Field in the Database—Bypassing INPUT Transform

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">SEX////m</span>

### Variable Stuffs

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

An even more powerful kind of default is the variable default. In this mode, you specify, *not* a literal value like the word MALE, but rather a field name from which to calculate the default value for each entry being edited.

One example of the usefulness of this kind of default is a case where you are editing two fields that usually have the same value. Suppose that, for a set of patients, you want to enter a NEXT OF KIN field, followed by a BENEFICIARY field. Once you have typed a patient’s NEXT OF KIN, you want to see that answer as the default value of BENEFICIARY.

The process would look like <u>Figure 59</u>:

<span id="_Ref462324753" class="anchor"></span>Figure 59: Advanced Edit Techniques—Example of “Stuffing” a Variable Default Value into a Field in the Database

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <span class="mark">NEXT OF KIN</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">BENEFICIARY//NEXT OF KIN</span>

DO YOU MEAN 'NEXT OF KIN' AS A VARIABLE? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,11</span>

NEXT OF KIN: <span class="mark">MRS CLOSERELATIVE FMPATIENT</span>

BENEFICIARY: MRS CLOSERELATIVE FMPATIENT// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,14</span>

NEXT OF KIN: <span class="mark">MR CLOSERELATIVE FMPATIENT</span>

BENEFICIARY: MR CLOSERELATIVE FMPATIENT// <span class="mark">MISS CLOSERELATIVE_2 FMPATIENT</span>

Here, Mrs. CLOSERELATIVE FMPATIENT ends up as both the NEXT OF KIN and BENEFICIARY for 11 FMPATIENT, while 14 FMPATIENT’s NEXT OF KIN and BENEFICIARY are two distinct people.

A variable default value can be any computed expression—such as LAST VISIT DATE+365.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/059.png) REF: For more information on computed expressions, see the “<u>Computed Expressions</u>” section.

### WORD-PROCESSING Field Stuffing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The effect of stuffing values in a DATA TYPE field of WORD-PROCESSING is like defaults for other fields: the default value becomes the first line of the word-processing text. Also, you can stuff many lines of text into a DATA TYPE field of WORD-PROCESSING by use of a computed expression that has a Multiline value (e.g., another WORD-PROCESSING-type field).

Alternatively, you can automatically append data to a DATA TYPE field of WORD-PROCESSING by following the // or // with a + sign. This means add on the text shown in <u>Figure 60</u> to whatever may already be on file. Taking the example of the WORD-PROCESSING-type HISTORY field data in the PATIENT (#2) file:

<span id="_Ref389633348" class="anchor"></span>Figure 60: Advanced Edit Techniques—Appending Text on to a WORD-PROCESSING Field Value

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">DIAGNOSIS</span>

EDIT WHICH DIAGNOSIS SUB-FIELD: <span class="mark">HISTORY//+ This case is essentially normal</span>

The text string following the “//+” is appended automatically to any HISTORY field text that already exists for the chosen patient and diagnosis. If no HISTORY field text existed, the string would become Line 1 of the HISTORY field text.

When editing the entry, you see the text with the addition and can edit it in the usual way. If you use three slashes (“///”) instead of two, the addition is made, and you are *not* presented with the text to edit.

### Looping (^LOOP)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option allows you to loop through a group of entries, without having to select each entry individually. After choosing the fields to edit, enter the entire word ^LOOP in upper- or lowercase. Then, you can choose which entries to loop through by responding to the “EDIT ENTRIES BY:” and “START WITH ... GO TO” prompts. Answer these prompts in the same way that you respond to the “SORT BY:” and “START WITH ... GO TO” prompts in the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/060.png) REF: For more details, see the “Specifying SORT BY Fields” topic in the “Print: How to Print Reports from Files” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

In <u>Figure 61</u>, all entries would be looped through:

This ^LOOP feature, in combination with the ///-stuff convention, makes it easy to load data values into newly created fields.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/062.png) CAUTION: Use caution with the automatic loading and automatic deleting features of VA FileMan, since these features loop through entries and make changes *without stopping* for verification.

For example, suppose you have a patient database to which a new field called FOLLOW-UP DATE has been added. You want to create values for this field for all patients who have LAST VISIT DATEs earlier than 1977 on file. For all such patients, you want FOLLOW-UP DATE set equal to JUNE 1, 1982. Use the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option as shown in <u>Figure 62</u>:

<span id="_Ref462326558" class="anchor"></span>Figure 62: Advanced Edit Techniques—Example of Loading Data into a Newly Created Field for Select Records

Now, without keyboard input, the system automatically loads the June 1, 1982, data value into each entry’s new FOLLOW-UP DATE field while looping through LAST VISIT DATEs up to 1977.

## INPUT Templates

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Just as you can store complex output specifications in a PRINT or a SORT template for later use, you can store a long list of edit fields in an INPUT template. If you answer the “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompt at least five different times, or if you answer it with a right bracket ( \] ), you are prompted for a template name, as shown in <u>Figure 64</u>:

<span id="_Ref389629724" class="anchor"></span>Figure 64: Advanced Edit Techniques—Storing a List of Edit Fields in an INPUT Template

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES</span>

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <span class="mark">NAME</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">DATE OF BIRTH</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">\]</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

STORE THESE FIELDS IN TEMPLATE: <span class="mark">UPDATE</span>

In this example (<u>Figure 64</u>), UPDATE is the name of the template. You notice that brackets were *not* included.

When stored in a template, the input specifications can be easily recalled in the future without retyping them. The template name *must* be from 2 to 30 characters in length; do *not* begin the template name with a bracket. Any field numbers (with their defaults and other qualifications, if you have specified any) are stored. When you return to this option, you can edit the same fields again in the same way by answering the “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompt with the name of the template enclosed in brackets, (e.g., \[UPDATE\]).

When you return to use an INPUT template in this way, you are asked to edit its field specifications. If you answer YES, you first see the template name, which you can then edit. Entering an at-sign (@) at the “NAME:” prompt deletes the entire INPUT template.

You can then edit the security codes for READ and WRITE access, and then the original answers to the “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompts.

If your previous answer is less than 20 characters, it is followed by two slashes (//), after which you can re-enter the line. Longer answers are followed by “Replace” and are edited with the “Replace…With” syntax. Deleting with the at-sign (@) works in either case.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/063.png) REF: The “Replace…With” syntax is described in the “Longer Default Responses and the ‘Replace … With’ Editor” topic in the “VA FileMan Prompts” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

To insert a new field ahead of the field being displayed, precede your line with a caret (^). When you have finished, you can save your edited INPUT template under the same name (use \<Spacebar\>\<Enter\>) or a new one.

You can create a special INPUT template by entering the right bracket ( \] ) at the “EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//” prompt. This template contains all the fields currently in the file and updates the template when new fields are added to the file.

STORE THESE FIELDS IN TEMPLATE: <span class="mark">EVERY FIELD</span>

### Branching within INPUT Templates

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Sometimes, you want to dynamically control editing based on the responses given for a particular entry or on other aspects of the editing session. By using a technique called branching, the designer of an INPUT template can make the presentation of certain fields conditional based on the values of other fields. You *must* have Programmer access to set up branching. With Programmer access, any executable M code can be put into an INPUT template.

You can branch either to a field prompt elsewhere in the template or to a predefined place holder. The place holder is identified by @*n*, where “*n*” is an integer (e.g., @1).

To branch within an INPUT template, you enter M code at one of the “EDIT FIELD:” prompts. You set the variable Y to the branch destination. The Y variable can be given the value of a field label, a field number, or a place holder:

- If Y is set to Zero and editing is being done at the top-level of a file, the template is exited.
- If Y is set to Zero and a Multiple is being edited, the Multiple is exited.

The variable X contains the *updated*, *internal* value of the field edited at the previous prompt. Thus, you can check X to determine if you want to set Y to branch or not. For example, suppose you had a file called ADMISSIONS. Some of the fields are concerned only with the discharge of a patient. You want to branch around those fields if the DATE OF DISCHARGE is empty in the database and no date is given in the current editing session. Your template could be defined as shown in <u>Figure 66</u>:

<span id="_Ref462326559" class="anchor"></span>Figure 66: Advanced Edit Techniques—Defining INPUT Template to Branch to Different Field Based on another Field’s Value (1 of 2)

STORE THESE FIELDS IN TEMPLATE: <span class="mark">EDIT ADMISSION</span>

Are you adding 'EDIT ADMISSION' as a new INPUT TEMPLATE? <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

This template branches around the discharge-related questions, if the DATE OF DISCHARGE is NULL.

If you wanted to further enhance the template to ask for MEDICARE NUMBER only if BILLING METHOD is M (for Medicare), you could change the template, as shown in <u>Figure 67</u>:

<span id="_Ref462326560" class="anchor"></span>Figure 67: Advanced Edit Techniques—Defining INPUT Template to Branch to Different Field Based on another Field’s Value (2 of 2)

(OCT 31, 1991@14:17) USER \#2 FILE \#16155

EDIT ADMISSION TEMPLATE ALREADY EXISTS.... OK TO REPLACE? <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

After the BILLING METHOD field is edited, a test is made of its contents. It is a DATA TYPE field of SET OF CODES; thus, the test is for the letter M alone (the internal value of the field). If it is equal to M, the template branches to the MEDICARE NUMBER field. If it is *not* equal to M, the template proceeds to the next prompt where Y is set unconditionally to Zero. The template is exited here so that the “MEDICARE NUMBER” prompt is *not* shown when it is *not* needed.

An editing session using this template to add a new admission might look like <u>Figure 68</u>:

<span id="_Ref462326561" class="anchor"></span>Figure 68: Advanced Edit Techniques—Example Verifying Automatic Branching to Other Fields Based on User’s Entry (1 of 2)

Select ADMISSIONS NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,19</span>

BILLING METHOD: <span class="mark">M \<Enter\></span> MEDICARE

MEDICARE NUMBER: <span class="mark">3093-0393</span>

The discharge related questions were skipped, and the “MEDICARE NUMBER:” prompt was given. A future editing of this record upon patient discharge could look like <u>Figure 69</u>:

<span id="_Ref462326562" class="anchor"></span>Figure 69: Advanced Edit Techniques—Example Verifying Automatic Branching to Other Fields Based on User’s Entry (2 of 2)

Select ADMISSIONS NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,19</span>

DISCHARGING PHYSICIAN: <span class="mark">FMPROVIDER,4</span>

FOLLOW-UP DATE: <span class="mark">6/1/90 \<Enter\></span> (JUN 01, 1990)

BILLING METHOD: MEDICARE// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

MEDICARE NUMBER: 3093-0393// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

There is a potential hazard in using branching. In this example, suppose the BILLING METHOD were changed to “P” (for private insurance). The simple branching logic used would *not* show you the MEDICARE NUMBER field to edit or delete. You *must* ensure that your template can handle this kind of situation. In this example, if you have Programmer access to do so, you might add M code to delete the MEDICARE NUMBER, if BILLING METHOD were *not* equal to “M”.

## Edit Qualifiers

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Edit Qualifiers and Customizing Data Editing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When creating an INPUT template, there are several ways you can control the editing session to display customized prompts, to enable the duplication of data by pressing the Spacebar and the Enter keys (\<Spacebar\>\<Enter\>), and to make a field required.

<u>Table 5</u> summarizes the edit qualifiers you can use to accomplish these results. They are described in more detail in the next three sections. Enter these qualifiers in conjunction with fields at the “EDIT FIELD:” prompt.

| Qualifier        | Action                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| field; “xxx” | Replace the field’s label with a literal string during an editing session (see the “<u>Forcing Special Prompts</u>” section).           |
| field;T      | Replace a field’s label with its title during an editing session (see the “<u>Forcing Special Prompts</u>” section).                    |
| field;DUP    | Save responses for later use with \<Spacebar\>\<Enter\> and allow their recall (see the “<u>Duplicating Input Values</u>” section). |
| field;REQ    | Require a response to a field that is usually *not* required (see the “<u>Forcing Special Prompts</u>” section).                        |

<span id="_Ref447356295" class="anchor"></span>Table 6: Advanced Edit Techniques—Text Formatting Expressions in Word-Processing Windows

You can combine specifiers if you separate them with semicolons (e.g., DATE OF BIRTH;T;REQ).

### Forcing Special Prompts

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Normally, the standard label or name of a field is used to ask the user for the input value of that field. You can customize the prompt for a field by answering the “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompt with the label, followed by a semi-colon (;) and the desired prompt in quotation marks. Thus:

EDIT WHICH FIELD: DATE OF BIRTH;"DOB"

Causes the DATE OF BIRTH field to be presented in the form:

DOB:

Or, in the form:

DOB: APR 1, 1923//

To use the field’s title instead of its label as the input prompt, follow the field name (or number) with ;T. Thus, when editing the PATIENT (#2) file, you can enter:

<span id="_Toc342980673" class="anchor"></span>Figure 70: Advanced Edit Techniques—Example Using the Title Edit Qualifier

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">.01 \<Enter\></span> NAME

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">SSN;T</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

If you enter these specifications *and* if this field’s title is defined as “Social Security Number,” the user encounters the “Social Security Number:” prompt instead of the “SSN:” prompt.

### Duplicating Input Values

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Sometimes many entries need the same data value input for a particular field. If you follow a field label with ;DUP when selecting the field for editing, VA FileMan uses the data value that was just input for the prior entry, if you enter a single space character (\<Spacebar\>\<Enter\>) at the field prompt. For example:

<span id="_Toc342980674" class="anchor"></span>Figure 71: Advanced Edit Techniques—Example Using the Duplicate Edit Qualifier

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">SEX;DUP</span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/064.png) NOTE: If all entries have the same data value, you can instead use the ^LOOP facility described earlier in this section.

### Forcing Required Input

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When creating an INPUT template, VA FileMan allows you to designate fields as required. Designating a field as required means that the user *must* enter data in that field. To do this, follow the field name with ;REQ. The required specification looks like <u>Figure 72</u>:

<span id="_Ref462326563" class="anchor"></span>Figure 72: Advanced Edit Techniques—Example Using the Required Edit Qualifier

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME;REQ</span>

Adding ;REQ does *not permanently* affect the definition of the field. It is only effective for the current input session or for the specific INPUT template. To *permanently* make a field mandatory, use the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option.

## Text Formatting in Word-Processing Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Word Wrapping

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Word wrapping is performed when a WORD-PROCESSING-type field is printed. Two functions occur as part of word wrapping during prints:

- Lines are “filled” to the right margin.
- Lines are “broken” only at word breaks.

If word wrap is on (a data dictionary setting for the WORD-PROCESSING-type field in question), you can *override* the word wrapping function and force a line to be printed as it appears in the editor by doing one of the following with the line:

- Starting the line with a space.
- Pressing the Tab key at the end of the line while using the Line Editor, or type \|Tab\| at the end of the line while using the Screen Editor.
- Turning wrap off by using the \|NOWRAP\| function described below.

Lines that contain only punctuation are always printed as is. Thus, if you put a single space on a line, the previous line is *not* filled and the subsequent line begins in column one.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/065.png) NOTE: The editor’s line numbers are meaningful only when editing. Since word-processing data is usually printed in a wraparound mode, what is internally line three might be printed as lines five and six.

### Tabs

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Tabs can be meaningful wherever they occur in a line.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/066.png) NOTE: If you insert a tab by typing the special Tab key on the keyboard (or \<Ctrl-I\> on terminals without a Tab key), a \|Tab\| is inserted in the text instead. When editing, a tab is recognized as \|Tab\|, *not* as five blank spaces.

### Formatting Text with Word-processing Windows (Frames) \| \|

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Expressions framed by vertical bars (“\| \|”) are known as word-processing *windows* or *frames* and are evaluated as computed expression at print-time and are printed as evaluated. (MailMan does *not typically* evaluate expressions within vertical bars, neither does the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option or the CAPTIONED PRINT template.) For example, \|TODAY+1\| prints out tomorrow’s date.

You can use word-processing windows to insert one of the following into the text of a WORD-PROCESSING-type field when that WORD-PROCESSING-type field is printed:

- A Field Name.
- A Computed Expression.
- Text Formatting Expression.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/067.png) REF: For details of how to compose and use computed expressions, see the “<u>Computed Expressions</u>” section.

### Text Formatting Expressions in Word-Processing Windows

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Table 6</u> lists the recognized special text formatting functions that you can use within word-processing windows. Most of these functions can be used in other contexts—for example, at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompt.

# Computed Expressions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use computed expressions in several places within VA FileMan to obtain, manipulate, modify, and format data. Computed expressions consist of one or more elements linked together with operators. Most computed expressions return a value after performing the actions you have requested. The way this result is used or displayed depends on where you have used the computed expression.

## Syntax

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Elements of Computed Expressions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use any of the following elements in constructing a computed expression:

- A field name within the current file (e.g., RELIGION). The field name can be partially spelled (e.g., REL), if the partial spelling is unambiguous.
- A field number, preceded with \# (e.g., #3).
- A literal number. When used as part of a computed expression, do *not* use quotes (e.g., AGE AT ONSET+20). However, you *must* use quotes if the number will stand alone as a constant (e.g., “3.14159265”).
- A literal text string, in quotes (e.g., “HELLO”).
- A validly formatted date, such as 20 JULY 1969, which is punctuated only by spaces.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/071.png) NOTE: Dashes in a computed expression are interpreted as minus signs. For example, 7-20-1969 would indicate subtraction and be evaluated as -1982.

- The word NUMBER (or the name of the file followed by the word NUMBER, such as, PATIENT NUMBER). NUMBER returns the internal entry number of the entry in the file or subfile in question.
- The name of a file followed by the name of a field in that file (e.g., PATIENT NAME). Like PATIENT NUMBER, this syntax is helpful when it is unclear to which file or subfile an expression is referring. However, this syntax *cannot* obtain data from another file; NAME and PATIENT NAME returns the same data. To obtain data from another file, the extended pointer syntax *must* be used.

### Operators in Computed Expressions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Computed expressions can consist of a single element. However, often several elements are joined together using operators. Operators are characters that perform some action on elements.

- <u>Unary Operators</u>
- <u>Binary Operators</u>
- <u>BOOLEAN Data Type</u>
- <u>Parentheses in Expressions</u>
- <u>Example of Compound Expression</u>

#### Unary Operators

The simplest operators are the unary operators. They force a numeric interpretation of the element that follows. They can also affect the sign of the resulting number. <u>Table 7</u> lists the unary operators:

| Operator | Description                                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| +    | Positive numeric interpretation (sign unchanged) |
| -    | Negative numeric interpretation (sign changed)   |

<span id="_Ref389633391" class="anchor"></span>Table 8: Computed Expressions—Binary Operators

#### Binary Operators

Another set of operators takes two elements, manipulates them, and returns a result. These are called binary operators. You can use the binary operators listed in <u>Table 8</u> in computed expressions:

| Operator | Description                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| +    | Addition                                      |
| -    | Subtraction                                   |
| \*   | Multiplication                                |
| /    | Division                                      |
| \\   | Integer (truncated) division (e.g., 13\2 = 6) |
| \_   | Concatenation (e.g., ”AB”\_”CDE” = ABCDE)     |

<span id="_Ref389718192" class="anchor"></span>Table 9: Computed Expressions—Boolean Operators

#### Boolean Operators

A third set of operators makes a comparison between two elements and returns a true or false value. These are known as Boolean operators. If the outcome of a Boolean operation is:

- True—One (1) is returned.
- False—Zero (0) is returned.

You can use the Boolean operators listed in <u>Table 9</u> in computed expressions:

| Operator | Description                                                      |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \>   | Greater than                                                     |
| \<   | Less than                                                        |
| =    | Equal to                                                         |
| \]   | Follows (in alphabetical order)                                  |
| \[   | Contains (e.g., “AB”\[“A” is true; “A”\[“AB” is false)       |
| !    | Or, either element is true \[e.g., (2=3)!(5\<10) is true\]   |
| &    | And, both elements are true \[e.g., (2=3)&(5\<10) is false\] |

<span id="_Ref160529060" class="anchor"></span>Table 10: Computed Expressions—Example Indicating Possible Results of Computed Expression Based on Different Entries to “Totaling” Prompt

An apostrophe (‘) means negation or *not*. It can precede any of the Boolean operators. Thus, 6’\>8 is read six is *not* greater than eight, which is true (a one is returned).

#### Parentheses in Expressions

In the absence of parentheses, the expression is evaluated strictly left to right. One operator is *not* given precedence over another. Use parentheses to control the order in which the operations of a computed expression are performed. Expressions within parentheses are evaluated first. Thus, 3+4/2 is 3.5, whereas 3+(4/2) is 5.

You can also use parentheses to ensure that the enclosed material is treated as an expression when there might be some ambiguity. For example, suppose you want to force a numeric interpretation of the SSN field. You need to use the + unary operator. However, the following does *not* yield the desired result:

SORT BY: +SSN

Is the + the unary operator or the sort specifier (meaning that you want to subtotal results by SSN)? In this case, it is interpreted as the sort specifier. However, if you put the expression in parentheses, the + is interpreted as an operator:

SORT BY: (+SSN)

#### Example of Compound Expression

The following is an example of a computed expression containing several elements and operators:

"Beds occupied: "\_(NUMBER OF BEDS\*OCCUPANCY PERCENTAGE/100)

First, the part within the parentheses is evaluated. NUMBER OF BEDS and OCCUPANCY PERCENTAGE are field names. Their contents are multiplied, and the result is divided by 100. That result is concatenated with the literal string “Beds occupied: ” giving a result like:

Beds occupied: 484

### Data Types in Computed Expressions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you are working with file data in computed expressions, you *must* consider the appropriateness of the DATA TYPE field value for the operation or function you are using. The following are some notes regarding data types and computed expressions:

- <u>SET OF CODES, POINTER TO A FILE, and VARIABLE-POINTER Data Types</u>
- <u>DATE/TIME Data Type</u>
- <u>WORD-PROCESSING Data Type</u>

#### SET OF CODES, POINTER TO A FILE, and VARIABLE-POINTER Data Types

These data types are manipulated using the external representations, *not* the internal ones. The internal value can be accessed using the INTERNAL function.

#### DATE/TIME Data Type

The DATA TYPE field value of DATE/TIME usually yields results based on the internal value of the field when used in a computed expression. For example, the computed expression “DATE OF BIRTH: “\_DOB, where DOB is a field with a DATA TYPE field value of DATE/TIME, yields “DATE OF BIRTH: 2910713”, where 2910713 is the internal representation of the date.

Often, you do *not* want the internal representation of the date to be used for output. There are alternatives. Continuing with concatenation as an example, you can concatenate a caption with the output of a function (e.g., “DATE OF BIRTH: ” \_NUMDATE(DOB) yields “DATE OF BIRTH: 07/13/91”). When using the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option, you can separately identify the caption as shown in <u>Figure 73</u>:

<span id="_Ref462326566" class="anchor"></span>Figure 73: Computed Expressions—Example Using the Print File Entries Option to Identify a Caption

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">"DATE OF BIRTH: "</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">DOB;X</span>

Since DOB was *not* entered as part of a computed expression, it produces output in VA FileMan’s external date format: “DATE OF BIRTH: JUL 13, 1991”.

You can perform certain arithmetic operations with DATA TYPE field values of DATE/TIME that directly yield useful results:

- If you subtract a DATA TYPE field value of DATE/TIME from another DATE/TIME-valued field, the result is the number of days the two differ.
- If you add a number to or subtract a number from a DATE/TIME-valued field, the result is a new date. For example, if the DOB field has the value JUL 20, 1969, then the value of the computed expression DOB+30 is AUG 19, 1969.

#### WORD-PROCESSING Data Type

DATA TYPE fields with a value of WORD-PROCESSING can be manipulated only with the contains (left bracket, \[ ) operator (e.g., a valid computed expression within the DIAGNOSIS Multiple of the sample PATIENT \[#2\] file is HISTORY\[“poverty”). This Boolean expression is true, if the DIAGNOSIS in question has HISTORY text that contains the string “poverty”.

Also, you *cannot concatenate*WORD-PROCESSING-type fields with other values using the concatenation (underscore, \_ ) operator.

### Using Functions as Elements in Computed Expressions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use recognized functions as an element in any COMPUTED field expression. A function performs an operation that returns a value. These functions are available to all users. Functions can also be added by making entries in the FUNCTION (#.5) file. If you examine this file, you will know all functions available to you.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/074.png) REF: For a description on how to add functions, see the “VA FileMan Functions (Creating)” section in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

Some functions require an argument or arguments; others are “argumentless.” The arguments of the function can be any element, including field name, field number (preceded with the \#), quoted literal, or even other functions. The SQUAREROOT function, for example, would take an argument of 64 and return 8. Thus, if the AGE field of a patient has the value 64, the expression SQUAREROOT(AGE) would equal 8.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/075.png) REF: For information on the syntax and description of the functions exported with VA FileMan, see the “<u>VA FileMan Functions</u>” section.

## Where to Use

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Using Computed Expressions in COMPUTED Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

One important place where you can use a computed expression is in a field that is computed. The DATA TYPE field value of COMPUTED allows a computed expression to be stored in the data dictionary.

To define a field as COMPUTED, use the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option and reply to the “DATA TYPE:” prompt with “COMPUTED.”

<span id="_Toc342980681" class="anchor"></span>Figure 74: Computed Expressions—Defining a DATA TYPE Field as COMPUTED

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">MODIFY FILE ATTRIBUTES</span>

DO YOU WANT TO USER THE SCREEN-MODE VERSION? Yes// <span class="mark">NO \<Enter\></span> (No)

MODIFY WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">AGE</span>

Are you adding 'AGE' as a new FIELD (the 13TH)? <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

FIELD NUMBER: 13// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DATA TYPE OF AGE: <span class="mark">COMPUTED</span>

You now enter the computed expression that is stored in the AGE field. In this case, a function (TODAY), a field name (DATE OF BIRTH), and a numeric literal are combined with two arithmetic binary operators to give a numeric result.

<span id="_Toc342980682" class="anchor"></span>Figure 75: Computed Expressions—Entering the Computed Expression into a DATA TYPE Field of COMPUTED

'COMPUTED-FIELD' EXPRESSION: <span class="mark">TODAY-DATE OF BIRTH\365.25</span>

TRANSLATES TO THE FOLLOWING CODE:

S Y(16033,13,1)=\$S(\$D(^DIZ(16033,D0,0)):^(0),1:""),X=DT S  
X=X,X1=X,X2=\$P(Y(16033,13,1),U,3),X="" D:X2 ^%DTC:X1 S X=X\365.25

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/076.png) NOTE: You only see the generated code if you have Programmer access.

When creating a COMPUTED field that might have a numeric result, the dialog in <u>Figure 76</u> is presented:

<span id="_Ref389633654" class="anchor"></span>Figure 76: Computed Expressions—Sample Dialog Encountered with a COMPUTED Field with Expected Numeric Result: Selecting Number-Valued

NUMBER OF FRACTIONAL DIGITS TO OUTPUT (ONLY ANSWER IF NUMBER-VALUED): <span class="mark">0</span>

Pressing the Enter key without an entry at this prompt means that the field is *not* numeric; it is left justified on output. If you do answer (<u>Figure 76</u>), you indicate that the field is numeric and that you want the computed value rounded to a certain number of decimal places when it is printed. In this case, the number is rounded to a whole number.

<span id="_Toc342980684" class="anchor"></span>Figure 77: Computed Expressions—Sample Dialog Encountered with a COMPUTED Field with Expected Numeric Result: Setting Rounding Value

SHOULD VALUE ALWAYS BE INTERNALLY ROUNDED TO 0 DECIMAL PLACES?

No// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (No)

Since the value of a COMPUTED field can be used in other calculations, you need to indicate when rounding should occur. If you accept the default (i.e., “No”), rounding is *not* done when the COMPUTED field is used in other calculations. A YES answer to this prompt means that you do want the rounded value used in calculations. Usually, you do *not* want values rounded at interim steps in a series of calculations. Thus, usually, you accept the “No” default.

When a COMPUTED field is printed, the value is always rounded to the number of decimal places you specify.

<span id="_Ref159853175" class="anchor"></span>Figure 78: Computed Expressions—Sample Dialog Encountered with a COMPUTED Field with Expected Numeric Result: Setting Totaling Value

WHEN TOTALLING THIS FIELD, SHOULD THE SUM BE COMPUTED FROM THE SUMS

OF THE COMPONENT FIELDS? No// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (No)

If your computed expression involves division or multiplication, you are asked how the field should be totaled (<u>Figure 78</u>):

- A NO answer to this prompt means that the COMPUTED field’s expression is evaluated for each entry and those results are added.
- A YES answer means that values of each of the fields in the COMPUTED field’s expression is added first and then the COMPUTED field’s expression is applied to those totals.

You can total the values of a field in the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option.

For example, suppose A and B are the names of two fields and A/B is a computed expression. <u>Table 10</u> shows the results of printing A, B, and A/B with different answers to the “WHEN TOTALLING THIS FIELD, ...” question:

</table>

<span id="_Ref389633983" class="anchor"></span>Table 11: VA FileMan Functions—Documentation Conventions

To summarize, if you want the total to be the ratio or product of the total of the component fields, then answer this question YES. Otherwise, a NO answer is appropriate.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/077.png) NOTE: The answer to this prompt only affects the Total produced by the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option\].

When defining a COMPUTED field, you are also asked:

<span id="_Toc342980687" class="anchor"></span>Figure 79: Computed Expressions—Dialog Encountered When Defining a COMPUTED Field

LENGTH OF FIELD: 8// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Here you can enter the maximum number of character positions that the field should occupy in output. The default value is eight, even if the COMPUTED field involves FREE TEXT-type fields. Be sure to allocate enough space to accommodate the results. If the COMPUTED field’s value is numeric, the entire result is displayed regardless of the requested length.

The COMPUTED-type field can be a very useful tool. Having set up such a field, you can then search or sort by it and include it in the definition of other COMPUTED-type fields. In the latter case, independence is preserved. Thus, for example, if you define COMPUTED Field \#2 in terms of COMPUTED Field \#1 and then decide to redefine Field \#1, Field \#2 automatically uses the new Field \#1 calculation. If you try to delete a field that is referenced by a COMPUTED-type field, you are warned.

### Where to Use Computed Expressions “On-the-Fly”

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### “On-the-Fly” Computed Expressions

In addition to permanently storing a computed expression in a data dictionary, there are several places within VA FileMan’s dialog where you can use a computed expression “on-the-fly”:

- <u>“PRINT FIELD:” Prompt</u>
- <u>“SEARCH FOR FIELD:” Prompt</u>
- <u>“SORT BY:” Prompt</u>
- <u>"Start with" and "Go to" SORT Values</u>
- <u>Field Value Stuffing</u>
- <u>OUTPUT Transforms</u>
- <u>Word-Processing Windows (\| \|)</u>

#### “PRINT FIELD:” Prompt

Whenever, you are within the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] or Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options, you are asked:

FIRST PRINT FIELD:

OR

THEN PRINT FIELD:

You can answer with a computed expression. For example:

<span id="_Toc342980688" class="anchor"></span>Figure 80: Computed Expressions—Entering a Computed Expression at a “PRINT FIELD” Prompt

FIRST PRINT FIELD: SEX\_"" ""\_RELIGION;"""";L33

This sample computed expression returns the contents of the SEX and RELIGION fields separated by a space. You can follow the computed expression with print qualifiers: ;“” to suppress the column heading and ;L33 to indicate that the COMPUTED field length can be 33 characters long.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/078.png) NOTE: If the computed expression begins with a quoted string, then the column heading will be suppressed as though the print qualifier ;“” had been specified.

A user with Programmer access can also enter M code at this prompt. The M code *must* have a WRITE statement for anything that is to be written to the report.

#### “SEARCH FOR FIELD:” Prompt

In the Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] option, you can answer the following prompt with a computed expression:

SEARCH FOR FIELD:

If the expression is Boolean (i.e., its value is either true or false), you are *not* asked the condition of the search, because the computed expression itself specifies that condition.

A user with Programmer access can also enter M code at this prompt. The M code *must* set the variable X to whatever is compared against the search value.

#### “SORT BY:” Prompt

In the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] or Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options, you can answer the “SORT BY:” prompt with a computed expression.

If the expression is Boolean (i.e., its value is either true or false), you are *not* asked the condition of the search, because the computed expression itself specifies that condition.

A user with Programmer access can also enter M code at this prompt. The M code *must* set variable X to the sort value.

For example, if you want to print a list of the names of all patients who are Baptists, you could enter:

<span id="_Toc342980689" class="anchor"></span>Figure 81: Computed Expressions—Entering a Computed Expression at a “SORT BY” Prompt

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">PRINT FILE ENTRIES</span>

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

SORT BY: <span class="mark">RELIGION="BAPTIST"</span>

WITHIN RELIGION="BAPTIST", SORT BY: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME</span>

This is a common way to select certain records for printing.

#### "Start with" and "Go to" SORT Values

In the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] or Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options, if the “SORT BY:” prompt is answered, the user is asked for the range of values by which to sort. Sometimes it is convenient to have the values of these answers be computed at run time. In such cases, if the answers are preceded with @, they can be understood as computed expressions.

For example, if you wanted the range of a certain date-valued field to be calculated for the week up to the day the output is run, do the following:

<span id="_Toc203326952" class="anchor"></span>Figure 82: Computed Expressions—Entering a Computed Expression at the “Start with…” and “Go to…” Prompt

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">PRINT FILE ENTRIES</span>

Output from what File: <span class="mark">PTF</span>

Sort by: NUMBER// <span class="mark">DISCHARGE DATE</span>

Start with DISCHARGE DATE: FIRST// <span class="mark">@TODAY-6</span>

DO YOU MEAN 'TODAY-6' AS A VARIABLE? Yes// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (Yes)

Go to DISCHARGE DATE: LAST// <span class="mark">@TODAY</span>

DO YOU MEAN 'TODAY' AS A VARIABLE? Yes// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (Yes)

Within DISCHARGE DATE, Sort by:

....

#### Field Value Stuffing

In the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option, you can follow the // or /// specifiers with computed expressions. The expression is evaluated for the entry you are inputting and used as a variable stuff value.

Suppose you want to put the current contents of a patient’s NEXT OF KIN field into the BENEFICIARY field, with a notation that this value is UNVERIFIED, for all patients who do *not* have a value in the BENEFICIARY field. The dialog would look like <u>Figure 83</u>:

<span id="_Ref160529117" class="anchor"></span>Figure 83: Computed Expressions—“Stuffing” a Value in a Field via a Computed Expression

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES</span>

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

EDIT WHICH FIELD: <span class="mark">BENEFICIARY///NEXT OF KIN\_" (UNVERIFIED)"</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">^LOOP</span>

EDIT ENTRIES BY: <span class="mark">BENEFICIARY=""</span>

WITHIN BENEFICIARY="", EDIT ENTRIES BY: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

This example uses two “on-the-fly” expressions:

- Answer to the “EDIT ENTRIES BY:” prompt (which is essentially a SORT BY for looping).
- Forced default value for the BENEFICIARY input field.

BENEFICIARY= “” is a Boolean (True/False) computed expression that means “The BENEFICIARY value equals NULL.”

After the previous dialog, the names of such patients would be printed out, and their BENEFICIARY value would automatically be set equal to their NEXT OF KIN field value, concatenated with a space followed by “(UNVERIFIED).”

#### OUTPUT Transforms

OUTPUT transforms change the way a field is displayed when printed. Frequently, the OUTPUT transform contains a computed expression that alters the data stored internally in the field. A simple OUTPUT transform that converts the internally stored date into MM/DD/YY format is shown in <u>Figure 84</u>:

<span id="_Ref160529265" class="anchor"></span>Figure 84: Computed Expressions—Entering a Computed Expression in an OUTPUT Transform

DATE OF BIRTH OUTPUT TRANSFORM: <span class="mark">NUMDATE(DATE OF BIRTH)</span>

If an OUTPUT transform is applied to a field, the result of the transform is used if that field is used in another computed expression. For example, if DATE OF BIRTH is used in a PRINT template, the “transformed” value is output, as shown in <u>Figure 85</u>:

<span id="_Ref160529204" class="anchor"></span>Figure 85: Computed Expressions—Entering a Computed Expression in an OUTPUT Transform Attached to a Field

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME\_"'S BIRTHDAY: "\_DATE OF BIRTH</span>

The result of this computed expression would be like <u>Figure 86</u>:

<span id="_Ref160529154" class="anchor"></span>Figure 86: Computed Expressions—Example of the Result of an OUTPUT Transform with a Computed Expression

ONE FMPATIENT'S BIRTHDAY: 03/07/42

#### Word-Processing Windows (\| \|)

When entering text into a DATA TYPE field with a value of WORD-PROCESSING, you can insert a computed expression within a \|Window\|. This expression is evaluated at the time the WORD-PROCESSING-type field is printed. If the expression is meaningful, its value replaces the \|Window\| in the printed output.

For example, you could embed within the text of the HISTORY WORD-PROCESSING-type field a \|Window\| containing a COMPUTED field expression:

<span id="_Toc342980694" class="anchor"></span>Figure 87: Computed Expressions—A \|Window\| with a Computed Expression

HISTORY:

1\> <span class="mark">PATIENT IS A \|SEX\_" "\_RELIGION\| WHO HAS NO</span>

2\> <span class="mark">APPARENT PROBLEMS.</span>

When this field is printed for a patient who has a SEX value of MALE and a RELIGION value of CATHOLIC, the output would look like <u>Figure 88</u>:

<span id="_Ref84337994" class="anchor"></span>Figure 88: Computed Expressions—Example of the Result of a \|Window\| with a Computed Expression

PATIENT IS A MALE CATHOLIC WHO HAS NO

APPARENT PROBLEMS.

## How to Use VA FileMan Functions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This section lists each VA FileMan function, including syntax and simple examples of their use. You can use them in any computed expression.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/079.png) REF: For more information on computed expressions, see the “<u>Computed Expressions</u>” section.

A function performs an operation that returns a value. Many functions are included with VA FileMan; you can also add functions by making entries in the FUNCTION (#.5) file.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/080.png) REF: For a description on how to add functions, see the “VA FileMan Functions (Creating)” section in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

Some functions require an argument or arguments; others are “argumentless.” The arguments of the function can be any element, including field name, field number (preceded with the \#), quoted literal, or even other functions. The SQUAREROOT function, for example, would take an argument of 64 and return 8. Thus, if the AGE field of a patient has the value 64, the expression SQUAREROOT(AGE) would return 8.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/081.png) NOTE: If there is an OUTPUT transform on a field, the function code is applied to the field after it has been transformed. In most cases, if a field has an OUTPUT transform, you should therefore use the syntax FUNCTION_NAME(INTERNAL(FIELD_NAME)), rather than FUNCTION_NAME(FIELD_NAME).

| Use:        | This function returns nothing. When used within a PRINT template, this function determines whether \<Ctrl\>C can be used to break out of a report print. If *n* = 1, \<Ctrl\>C breaks out; if *n* = 0, it does *not*. Under default conditions, \<Ctrl\>C breaks you out. The value of n is returned. |
| Example:    | BREAKABLE(0) =\>0; \[\<Ctrl\>C is disabled\]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## How to Generate Statistics from Reports

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan currently offers three types of statistical processing:

- <u>Descriptive Statistics</u>
- <u>Scattergram</u>
- <u>Histogram</u>

In each case, to generate statistics from reports, you use a two-step process:

1.  Use the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] or Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options to generate a VA FileMan report. Do *not* queue the report. The entries you select in your report are the ones on which statistics are generated; the way you use sort and print qualifiers in the report affects the way statistics are generated, as discussed later in this section.
12. Immediately after the report finishes, use the Statistics \[DISTATISTICS\] option, which is located on the Other Options \[DIOTHER\] menu under the VA FileMan \[DIUSER\] menu, to generate statistics.

The two-step process for each type of statistical output is described below.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/091.png) NOTE: If you have statistical software on a personal computer, you might want to consider using VA FileMan’s Export Tool as an alternative to VA FileMan’s statistics options, especially if the statistics options described in this section do *not* provide the statistical analysis you need. With the Export Tool, you can export your data into a format your personal computer statistical software can read and use all of that software’s capabilities to perform statistical analyses on VA FileMan data.

## Descriptive Statistics

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Descriptive Statistics routine creates a summary report of the numeric information produced by the preceding print. The number of cases is always shown.

To get descriptive statistics for fields printed out in a report, you *must* associate one of the qualifiers listed in <u>Table 82</u> with fields in the print:

| Qualifier | Description                                           |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| \#    | Count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum |
| +     | Count and mean                                        |

<span id="_Ref160614063" class="anchor"></span>Table 83: Statistics—Histogram Qualifiers

To obtain descriptive statistics:

1.  Print a report and use the \# or + print qualifiers on one or more fields.
13. Immediately after the report completes, generate the Descriptive Statistics based on the report.

## Scattergram

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you subtotal by two fields (i.e., sub-subtotal) in a sort, you can create Scattergrams for fields that were counted with !, +, or \# in the corresponding print.

Only numeric values are charted. The Scattergram is scaled to fit your output device’s row and column dimensions. Occurrences of more than nine points in a single print position are marked by an asterisk (\*).

## Histogram

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you subtotal by one or more fields in a sort, you can get Histograms for the fields that are preceded by \#, !, &, or + qualifiers in the corresponding print. The Histograms that you can produce depend on which print qualifier is used, as listed in <u>Table 83</u>:

| Qualifier | Description                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| !     | Produces a Count Histogram               |
| &     | Produces a Sum Histogram                 |
| +     | Produces Count, Sum, and Mean Histograms |
| \#    | Produces Count, Sum, and Mean Histograms |

# System Management

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan is designed to be used either with Kernel or as a standalone application running under a variety of implementations of ANSI standard M. If VA FileMan is used without Kernel, the basic DBMS features of VA FileMan all work as described in the manuals. However, there are some features (e.g., bulletin-type cross-references, print queuing, and Filegrams) that do *not* work without portions of Kernel. Whenever Kernel is needed to support a particular VA FileMan feature, that fact is mentioned in the manuals.

The installation of VA FileMan 22.2 is *not* integrated with the installation of Kernel. The *VA FileMan Installation Guide* contains instructions on how to install VA FileMan, both for standalone sites and for sites running Kernel.

## Setup

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Initialization

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan 22.2 is installed and initialized with a Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) build. That build installs all the VA FileMan routines, updates all VA FileMan files, populates those files with necessary data, and installs other necessary VA FileMan components (e.g., Kernel options). In the past, the VA FileMan DINIT routine was run to initialize the VA FileMan files. Now, DINIT is run automatically from the KIDS install. It should not be run independently after the install.

### Security

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan provides tools for application packages to protect their data. VA FileMan identifies users by a number in the local variable DUZ and user security by codes stored in the local variable DUZ(0).

## Standalone VA FileMan

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Device Handling for Standalone VA FileMan

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan requires a %ZIS routine. Kernel supplies a %ZIS as the device selection gateway to its device handler component. In addition to writing your own device selection routine and saving it as %ZIS, standalone users have two possibilities:

1.  You can have a device selection routine supplied by your M vendor. You can use the M vendor’s routine if it returns the variables expected by VA FileMan from such a device selection program. These variables are listed in <u>Table 84</u>. In this case, you simply create a %ZIS routine that calls the vendor-supplied routine.  
      
    However, even if you use a vendor’s (or your own) routine for device selection, you *must* have %ZISS, as described below, if you want to use VA FileMan’s screen-oriented utilities.
14. If you do *not* have another device selection routine, refile the DIIS and DIISS routines as described in the *VA FileMan Installation Guide*. This results in all VA FileMan output going to the terminal that requests it. If you do *not* modify the %ZIS and %ZISS routines as described below, your terminal is treated as a VT100 (ANSI) terminal.

VA FileMan controls terminals by using terminal characteristics stored in IO variables. In addition, certain operating system dependent actions are controlled by executing code stored in %ZOSF nodes. Together the IO variables and %ZOSF nodes allow full use of VA FileMan in both scrolling and screen-oriented modes. The instructions below describe how to modify the %ZIS and %ZISS routines to set the necessary IO variables, and how to set the necessary %ZOSF nodes.

#### Setting IO variables: %ZIS and %ZISS

%ZIS sets the IO variables required for terminal output that is *not* screen oriented. The DIIS routine supplied with VA FileMan sets the IO variables to the values specific to the VT100 terminal type. If you are using or emulating a VT100 terminal, you can rename the DIIS routine unmodified as %ZIS. If you are using or emulating a VT220 or VT320 terminal, you *must* modify %ZIS to set IOST equal to “C-VT220” or “C-VT320”.

<u>Table 84</u> lists the variables returned by %ZIS:

<span id="_Ref447500505" class="anchor"></span>Table 85: System Management—%ZISS Variables Returned

The %ZISS routine sets the IO variables required by VA FileMan’s screen-oriented utilities. The DIISS routine supplied by VA FileMan sets the IO variables according to the value of IOST. DIISS recognizes IOST values of C-VT220 and C-VT320. If IOST equals anything else, the IO variables are set to values specific to the VT100 terminal type.

Not all variables returned by %ZISS are required by VA FileMan’s screen-oriented utilities.

<span id="_Ref389634139" class="anchor"></span>Table 86: System Management—Optimal Procedures for Screen-Oriented Utilities: Based on Terminal Type

After you save DIISS as %ZISS, you can modify %ZISS to use ScreenMan on terminal types other than those supported in DIISS. The routine DIISS itself contains more information on how to modify the routine.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/094.png) NOTE: IO variables and DataTree MUMPS: If your version of DataTree MUMPS supports VT220 emulation, set up %ZIS and %ZISS for VT220 and use the emulation.

#### Summary of IO Setups

Depending on your terminal type, you need to take the appropriate action listed in <u>Table 86</u> to make full use of VA FileMan’s screen-oriented utilities.

| Terminal Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VT100                | No action needed; the default settings are acceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| VT220, VT320         | Edit the %ZIS routine to set IOST variable to “C-VT220” or “C-VT320”.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Other terminal types | Edit %ZIS to set IOST to “C-WHATEVER” and IOXY to the code to position the cursor for that terminal. Modify %ZISS routine to set all the IO variables for your terminal type. The routine contains instructions for a simple modification strategy. |

### NEW PERSON File for Standalone VA FileMan

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In general, the files you need to run VA FileMan without Kernel are installed by the DINIT routines. However, one file that is referenced by VA FileMan is *not* included (i.e., NEW PERSON \[#200\] file). Kernel supplies the NEW PERSON (#200) file.

This section describes the fields in the NEW PERSON (#200) file directly accessed by VA FileMan; this is a small subset of the fields in Kernel’s NEW PERSON (#200) file. The fields described contain characteristics of the VA FileMan users. If you set up a file in the proper global location with these fields, you enhance standalone VA FileMan’s functionality. However, the NEW PERSON (#200) file is *not* required to run standalone VA FileMan.

The NEW PERSON (#200) file needs to be established with a global root of ^VA(200,. Use the information in <u>Table 87</u> when creating the file using the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/095.png) REF: For a description of USER() function, see the “<u>USER</u>” section.

<span id="_Ref462324079" class="anchor"></span>Table 88: System Management—NEW PERSON (#200) File Fields to Define Key Variables in VA FileMan

In addition to these fields accessed directly by VA FileMan, Kernel uses the NEW PERSON (#200) file to set up VA FileMan key variables. You can define additional NEW PERSON (#200) file fields to use to define these local variables as shown in <u>Table 88</u>:

| Field Name                | Field \# | Node;Piece | Description                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Internal Entry Number     | —        | —          | Used to set DUZ for the user. There is no defined .001 field on the NEW PERSON (#200) file.                                 |
| FILE MANAGER ACCESS CODE  | 3        | 0;4        | Used to set DUZ(0) for user. A FREE TEXT field from 1 to 15 characters.                                                 |
| LANGUAGE                  | 200.07   | 200;7      | Used to set DUZ(“LANG”). A POINTER TO A FILE field that points to the LANGUAGE (#.85) file identifying the user’s language. |
| TIMED READ (# OF SECONDS) | 200.1    | 200;10     | Used to set DTIME for the user. A NUMERIC field with a value of 1 to 99999.                                         |

<span id="_Ref389662098" class="anchor"></span>Table 89: System Management—Description of the ^%ZOSF Nodes

When these additional fields are defined, you can use them in a signon routine to set these key variables.

Of course, you can choose to place additional information about the users in the NEW PERSON (#200) file. If you add other fields to the NEW PERSON (#200) file, use field numbers greater than 10,000 and use subfile numbers with at least 5 digits following the decimal place. Also, place the fields in global nodes subscripted with numbers greater than 10,000. If you numberspace your data elements in this way, you can avoid conflicts, if you later install Kernel’s NEW PERSON (#200) file.

## ^%ZOSF Nodes

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Manually Setting ^%ZOSF Nodes

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan’s screen-oriented utilities execute M operating system-specific code contained in ^%ZOSF nodes. Running the DINZMGR routine in the Manager Account, as explained in the *VA FileMan Installation Guide*, sets the necessary nodes. However, DINZMGR can only set the nodes for some operating systems. If you want to use screen-oriented features but your operating system is *not* supported by DINZMGR, you *must* set the nodes yourself.

The ^%ZOSF nodes and their meanings are listed in <u>Table 89</u>. Remember that the values stored in these nodes *must* be M code that, when executed, perform the indicated function. For example, X^%ZOSF(“EOFF”) would need to turn off the echo to the current device.

| ^%ZOSF Node       | Description                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| EOFF          | Turns off echo to the \$I device.           |

## Alternate Editors

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Setting Up Alternate Editors

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan supplies two editors:

- Line Editor
- Screen Editors

These editors are used for entering and changing text in WORD-PROCESSING-type fields. Other editors can be made available by using the ALTERNATE EDITOR (#1.2) file. Entries in this file specify the M code used to call the Alternate Editor and to restore the VA FileMan environment after work in the editor is complete.

The user can choose an editor in two ways:

1.  The PREFERRED EDITOR field in the NEW PERSON (#200) file is a pointer to the ALTERNATE EDITOR (#1.2) file. Any entry in the ALTERNATE EDITOR (#1.2) file can be selected as a Preferred Editor. Then, whenever a WORD-PROCESSING-type field is presented for editing, the user is automatically switched into this Preferred Editor.
15. From the Line Editor, the user can switch to any of the editors in the ALTERNATE EDITOR (#1.2) file temporarily by using the Editor Change option on the UTILITIES menu. After exiting the chosen editor, the user is returned to the \`.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/096.png) REF: For additional information about selecting editors, see the “Choice of Word-processing Editors” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

#### ALTERNATE EDITOR File Entries

The requirements of the ALTERNATE EDITOR (#1.2) file’s fields are explained in <u>Figure 95</u> of the creation of an entry in that file:

<span id="_Ref389631133" class="anchor"></span>Figure 95: System Management—Example of Creating an ALTERNATE EDITOR File Entry

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">ENTER \<Enter\></span> OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">ALTERNATE EDITOR \<Enter\></span> (2 entries)

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Select ALTERNATE EDITOR: <span class="mark">VMSEDT</span>

Are you adding 'VMSEDT' as a new ALTERNATE EDITOR (the 3RD)? No// <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

An entry needs to be added to the ALTERNATE EDITOR (#1.2) file. The NAME of every entry *must* begin with a unique character. This name is used to select the editor.

The required ACTIVATION CODE FROM DIWE field contains M code that invokes the Alternate Editor. In this case, a routine supplied by Kernel that invokes the VMS editor is called:

ACTIVATION CODE FROM DIWE: <span class="mark">G ^XTEDTVXD</span>

Usually, this code needs to:

1.  Extract the word-processing data from the WORD-PROCESSING-type field.
16. Present it to the Alternate Editor.
17. Return the edited text to the WORD-PROCESSING-type field.

DBS calls should be used to retrieve and file the text.

For example, if the text to be edited were in Field \#56 in File \#1234 use the following Data Retriever call to extract the text for entry 789:

S MYFDA="^TMP(""MYDATA"",\$J)" D GETS^DIQ(1234,"789,",56,"",MYFDA)

The text returns in nodes descendent from ^TMP(“MYDATA”,\$J,1234, “789,”,56).

After editing is complete, you can file the data from the same global array by using the following commands:

S MYFDA="^TMP(""MYDATA"")" D FILE^DIE("","MYFDA")

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/097.png) REF: For more details of the use of these calls, see the descriptions of the Data Retriever, Filer, and Word-processing Filer in the “Database Server (DBS) API” section in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

This task of returning the data to the WORD-PROCESSING-type field can also be accomplished by code in the [RETURN TO CALLING EDITOR field](#RETURN_TO_CALLING_EDITOR_field).

If the editor uses any local M variables beginning with D, they should be NEWed to avoid problems upon return to VA FileMan. Also, avoid calls to VA FileMan utilities in the fields that accept M code so that variables upon which VA FileMan depends (e.g., DA and D0) are *not* changed.

The OK TO RUN TEST field contains code that checks to determine whether it is OK to run the editor:

OK TO RUN TEST: I ^%ZOSF("OS")\["VAX"&(DUZ(0)\["@")

This field is optional; if nothing is entered, there are no restrictions on the use of the editor. The code should set \$T to true if it is OK to proceed or to false if it is *not*. If the code returns \$T=false, the user automatically returns to the Line Editor. In this example, the environment is being checked to ensure that the called editor is available, and it is verified that the user has the required VA FileMan Access Code.

M code entered into the optional <span id="RETURN_TO_CALLING_EDITOR_field" class="anchor"></span>RETURN TO CALLING EDITOR field can be used to restore the environment needed by the Line Editor:

RETURN TO CALLING EDITOR: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Since the user can switch editors at will, it is safest to restore the text to its previous location in the global and to maintain the local symbol table, as mentioned above. If these tasks are accomplished by code in the ACTIVATION CODE FROM DIWE field or by the called routine, this field is unnecessary.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/098.png) NOTE: The edited text *must* be restored; VA FileMan does *not* move text back to the proper global location.

The definition of the Alternate Editor is complete. An editor’s developer should provide information needed to set up an ALTERNATE EDITOR (#1.2) file entry. The local site manager has flexibility in setting up the editor. In particular, the OK TO RUN TEST field can be used to enforce local policies regarding access to editors.

## COMPILED ROUTINE File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### COMPILED ROUTINE File Cleanup: ENRLS^DIOZ()

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The COMPILED ROUTINE (#.83) file stores a list of numbers used to assign names to compiled sort routines. When a compiled SORT template is used in a print, the next available routine number is selected from the COMPILED ROUTINE (#.83) file. The routine name is then set to ^DISZ, concatenated with up to three Zeroes and the number from the COMPILED ROUTINE (#.83) file (e.g., if the number is four, the routine name becomes ^DISZ0004). After the print finishes, the routine number is released, and the routine is deleted. However, if the system goes down, the number may *not* be released. This procedure allows the site manager to release one or all numbers on the COMPILED ROUTINE (#.83) file for reuse and to delete the associated routines from the system.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/099.png) NOTE: This procedure should *never* be included in application code. It should only be run from the M Programmer prompt (aka command prompt). The routine should be run only when the system is inactive to avoid inadvertently deleting a routine that is in use.

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Compare Data Dictionaries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Transfer Entries \[DITRANSFER\] option, Namespace Compare option includes the ability to compare the data dictionaries across namespaces/UCIs located on the same servers to help with version control. The routine allows you to get a list of namespaces that can be accessed and the option to pick the file’s data dictionary that you wish to compare.

# List File Attributes

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The structures of VA FileMan files are stored in the data dictionary (DD). There, you can find the specifications of every field in every file. Frequently, you need to know the information in the DD (usually field names and descriptions) to successfully access and use the data in VA FileMan’s files.

The Data Dictionary Utilities submenu contains the following utilities that show information about files:

- <u>List File Attributes Option</u>
- <u>Map Pointer Relations Option</u>
- <u>Check/Fix DD Structure Option</u>
- [Find Pointers Into a File](#find-pointers-into-a-file-option)

## List File Attributes Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To get a listing of the fields in a file (and other file attributes), use the List File Attributes \[DILIST\] option. This listing displays the structure of the file and the characteristics of the fields in the file; it does *not* show entries, records, or any data contained in the file. This information can be very useful when deciding what fields to include in a report, or what fields to edit.

You have your choice of the following formats for the listing:

- [Brief](#brief-data-dictionary)
- [Condensed](#condensed-data-dictionary)
- [Standard](#standard-format) (or [Modified Standard](#modified-standard-format))
- [Custom-Tailored](#custom-tailored-data-dictionary)
- [Templates Only](#templates-only-format)
- [Global Map](#global-map)
- [Indexes and Cross-References Only](#indexes-and-cross-references-only)
- [Keys Only](#keys-only)

First, choose the file to display information about; you can use either its file number or name.

When you select the file, you have the option of requesting a range of files. If you select a range of files, the file number of the “go to” file *must* be higher than the file number of the “start with” file.

If you are prompted “Select SUB-FILE:”, this indicates that the file you are working with has Subfiles. If you want information only about a Subfile, specify the Subfile at this prompt. If you do *not* choose a Subfile, your listing usually includes information about all fields in the file, including those in all Subfiles.

Next, choose a format for the listing:

### Brief Data Dictionary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you choose Brief as the data dictionary format, a brief listing is produced; the Brief format is more readable but less complete than the default of a Standard listing. Next, you are asked for a destination for the listing’s output at the “DEVICE:” prompt. You can specify any valid printer or press the Enter key to send output to your screen as illustrated in <u>Figure 100</u>:

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/100.png) REF: For a detailed explanation of the source of the information displayed by the List File Attributes \[DILIST\] option, see the “<u>Creating Files and Fields</u>” section.

This data dictionary listing tells you that for each patient, the following information may be available:

- A NAME that is from 3 to 30 characters long.
- A recorded SEX of either m (MALE) or f (FEMALE).
- A DATE OF BIRTH.
- A RELIGION (for a list of all valid religions, you would have to consult a RELIGION file).
- One or more diagnoses and for each DIAGNOSIS; DIAGNOSIS is a Multiple-valued field that has the following information:
- An AGE AT ONSET
- A HISTORY
- A PROVIDER (e.g., a primary care physician). For a list of valid PROVIDERs, you would consult the NEW PERSON (#200) file. If the PROVIDER’s name does *not* appear, it can then be entered in the NEW PERSON (#200) file, since LAYGO (Learn-As-You-Go) has been allowed.
- A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN).

### Standard and Modified Standard Data Dictionaries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The most complete information about a file is obtained by using the Standard data dictionary format, which is the default for the List File Attributes \[DILIST\] option. In addition to detailed information about every field in the file, the Standard data dictionary format gives the file access, identifiers, cross-references, other files pointing to the file, files pointed to by the file, and any templates (including forms and blocks) associated with the file.

#### Standard Format

#### Modified Standard Format

Another data dictionary format is the Modified Standard format, which allows you to suppress printing the M code and to restrict the listing to specified groups of fields.

For example, the dialog in <u>Figure 104</u> eliminates the M code from the Standard listing and only prints those fields in the DEMOG group:

- NAME
- SEX
- DATE OF BIRTH
- SSN

<span id="_Ref389634271" class="anchor"></span>

And include GROUP: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/101.png) NOTE: If you answer the question concerning M code YES and do *not* specify any groups, the output from the Modified Standard format is the same as that of the Standard format.

### Custom-Tailored Data Dictionary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Custom-Tailored format allows you to select attributes of the fields for your report. You decide what information is displayed, and you determine the printed format of the output.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/102.png) REF: For a detailed description of the techniques used to control the format of output, see the “Print: How to Print Reports from Files” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

For this simple example in <u>Figure 105</u> you accept the default settings:

DO YOU WANT THE ENTIRE ATTRIBUTE LIST? <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

The “SORT BY:” prompt allows you to specify the order in which the data dictionary information is displayed.

In <u>Figure 106</u>, the user is asking for the entire list of possible attributes about a field that can be stored in the data dictionary. Typically, no field would have a value for every one of these attributes:

### Templates Only Format

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Templates Only format displays information about the templates (including forms and blocks) associated with a file. The output resembles the last part of the Standard data dictionary output.

### Global Map

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Global Map format shows the actual structure of the global (file) that contains the data for the file and its templates. This information is of primary interest to developers who can control how data is stored.

<u>Figure 110</u> is a sample Global Map:

## Map Pointer Relations Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Map Pointer Relations \[DI DDMAP\] option on the Data Dictionary Utilities \[DI DDU\] menu creates a graphic representation of the pointer relationships between files. Files are linked by POINTER TO A FILE and VARIABLE-POINTER field types.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/105.png) REF: These field types are described in the “<u>Creating Fields</u>” section.

You select an application package, a file, or a group of files to be mapped. If you select a package to map, you are given the opportunity to exclude a file or files from the map.

The initial dialog is displayed in <u>Figure 113</u>:

<span id="_Ref389723160" class="anchor"></span>Figure 113: List File Attributes—Example of the Dialog Encountered When Using the Map Pointer Relations Option

Select DATA DICTIONARY UTILITY OPTION: <span class="mark">MAP POINTER RELATIONS</span>

Prints a graph of pointer relations in a database of FileMan files

named in the Kernel PACKAGE file (9.4) or given separately.

Works best with 132 column output!

Select PACKAGE NAME: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Enter files to be included

Add FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

Add FILE: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Files included 16026 PATIENT

Enter name of file group for optional graph header: <span class="mark">PATIENT FILE</span>

DEVICE: HOME// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

In this instance, only a single file, the PATIENT file, has been selected for mapping. Of course, a more useful and complex map would be produced if an entire package or a large, related group of files were mapped.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/106.png) NOTE: You *must* have DD access to the PACKAGE (#9.4) file and to the files chosen at the “Add FILE:” prompt.

The output consists of three columns. The middle column has the target file or files, each surrounded by a box. This is the file or group of files that you asked to be mapped. To the left, in the first column, are the files and fields that point to the target file. An abbreviated description of the field is shown. To the right, in the last column, are any files that are pointed to by the target file. The output’s heading contains brief descriptions of the codes used.

A possible output for the PATIENT (#2) file is shown in <u>Figure 114</u>:

<span id="_Ref123736312" class="anchor"></span>Figure 114: List File Attributes—Example of the Output Produced with the Map Pointer Relations Option

File/Package: PATIENT FILE Date: MAY 31,1991

---------------------

ADMISSIONS (#16999) \| 16026 PATIENT \|

CLIENT .............. (N S L)-\> \| RELIGION \|-\> RELIGION

\| v PROVIDER \|-\> PERSON

\| \|-\> PROVIDER

---------------------

This output shows that the CLIENT field in the ADMISSIONS file points to the PATIENT (#2) file. LAYGO additions are allowed, and the ADMISSIONS file is *not* in the set of files being mapped. Further, the RELIGION field in the PATIENT file points to the RELIGION file and the PROVIDER field, a “v” (VARIABLE-POINTER), points to the PERSON and PROVIDER files. If the target file points to a file that is *not* in the account, the map shows:

\*\*\* NONEXISTENT FILE \*\*\*

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/107.png) REF: For a more elaborate example of a pointer map, see the “Pointer Map” section in the *VA FileMan Technical Manual*.

## Check/Fix DD Structure Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To ensure that the internal structure of your files and subfiles is consistent, use the Check/Fix DD Structure \[DI DDUCHK\] option from the Data Dictionary Utilities \[DI DDU\] menu. You *must* have READ access to the files being analyzed. In addition, you need DD access for this option to correct erroneous nodes.

This utility looks at a file’s identifiers, cross-references, POINTER TO A FILE, VARIABLE-POINTER, and COMPUTED fields. If there are inconsistencies or conflicts between the information in the data dictionary and the structure of the file’s global nodes, the Check/Fix DD Structure \[DI DDUCHK\] option notes them.

If you want, the Check/Fix DD Structure \[DI DDUCHK\] option corrects inconsistencies found in the data dictionary. The process does *not* change any file structures; it only removes or corrects unnecessary or incorrect DD nodes. Data is *not* affected.

The dialog for running this option is simple. You specify the file or files you want to check and indicate whether you want to delete incorrect nodes. Then the progress of the checking is displayed followed by a report of any discrepancies found or any changes made. For example:

<span id="_Ref447515755" class="anchor"></span>Figure 115: List File Attributes—Example of Dialog and Output Encountered When Using Check/Fix DD Structure Option

Select DATA DICTIONARY UTILITY OPTION: <span class="mark">CHECK/FIX DD STRUCTURE</span>

Checking FIELDs.

Returning to subfile 16033.04.

Returning to main file.......

Checking subfile \# 16033.01

Checking 'IX' nodes.

Checking FIELDs.

Returning to main file.........

In the previous example (<u>Figure 115</u>), the check is being run on a single file. Correction of erroneous nodes has been requested. An incorrect “PT” node was found and deleted.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/108.png) NOTE: Subfiles are inspected, too.

Application developers might use this tool to clean up their files before export. Site managers may find the reporting function useful for checking a package’s files after installation. Erroneous nodes that are found by this option can be remnants of prior versions of the files; the current install may *not* be to blame.

## Find Pointers Into a File Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Find Pointers Into a File \[DDU FIND POINTERS INTO A FILE\] option locates the entries in other files that point to your target file. You can specify the scope of the search.

The Find Pointers Into a File \[DDU FIND POINTERS INTO A FILE\] option is located on the Data Dictionary Utilities \[DI DDU\] menu. After you indicate which file you want analyzed, you can limit the extent of the analysis in the following ways:

- Only find pointers to a single entry in the target file.
- Find pointers to all entries in the target file.
- Only find pointers to the target file that point to a non-existent entry in that file (dangling pointers).
- Only find pointers to entries in a SEARCH template on the target file. You will see this option only if there are SEARCH templates on the target file.

The resulting report is sorted by pointing file. It displays the IEN of the pointed-to entry in the target file, the value of the .01 field in the pointing file of the entry that contains the pointer, and the Field Name of the pointing field in the pointing file.

In <u>Figure 116</u>, pointers to a single entry in the Patient file are found.

# Creating Files and Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Creating a File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To create a new file, use the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option and enter the new file name (from 3 to 45 characters in length) when asked:

MODIFY WHAT FILE:

Respond with YES when asked “Are you adding ‘*xxxxxxxx*’ as a new FILE?” (where “*xxxxxxxx*” represents the new file name).

### Naming a New File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

File names should be chosen so that they can easily be distinguished from each other:

MODIFY WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">ENT CLINIC PATIENT</span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/109.png) TIP: If different people are creating files, it can be helpful to include their initials, nick names, or other identifying phrases within the file name.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/110.png) NOTE: The name for your new file should *not* contain any arithmetic or string operators like + - \* / \\ \_ or punctuation like a colon (:).

An internal number *must* be assigned to this new file. You are prompted with the next available internal file number. You can either simply press Enter (a NULL response) to accept that number, or enter a number *not* already assigned to a file.

Your new file is now initialized. VA FileMan creates the NAME field (field number .01), which is:

- FREE TEXT.
- 3 to 30 characters in length.
- N*on*-numeric.
- Has no leading punctuation.

You see the following message:

A FreeText NAME Field (#.01) has been created.

The .01 field’s definition can be modified like any other field: it does *not* have to be FREE TEXT; its label need *not* be NAME; and so forth. The .01 field should be the key attribute of an entry used to identify it and to order the entries for lookups. However, entries can be identified and ordered by other fields through cross-references.

After creating a new file, you can define any number of fields for the new file, as described in the “<u>Creating Fields</u>” section.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/111.png) REF: For an example of a new file using the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

## Creating Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

For any file, you can create fields describing logically related data that pertains to entries in that file. When created, every file automatically receives one field: a NAME field (the \#.01 field). You *must* explicitly define any other fields. All such definitions are made (and changed) with the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option.

When you create a file, after you give the new file a name, you are asked:

Select FIELD:

Enter a new field name and respond with YES when VA FileMan asks:

Are you adding '*xxxxxxxx*' as a new FIELD?

The “*xxxxxxxx*” represents the name of the field you entered. After answering YES to this prompt, you are now ready to specify what sort of data the new field contains. A field can only be *one* type of data; the choices are listed in <u>Table 91</u>.

### Screen Mode Field Editing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When using the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option, you can make your field entries in the traditional Scrolling Mode or choose to create, modify, or review a file’s field attributes easily by running the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option in Screen Mode.

To make your entries in Screen Mode, simply press the Enter key to accept the default response at the “Do you want to use the screen-mode version? YES//” prompt.

<u>Figure 119</u> illustrates using Screen Mode when editing the .01 field of the ORDER (#100) file:

<span id="_Ref389631203" class="anchor"></span>Figure 119: Creating Files and Fields—Choosing Screen Mode When Using the Modify File Attributes Option

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">MOD \<Enter\></span> ify File Attributes

Do you want to use the screen-mode version? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

MODIFY WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">ORDER</span>

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">.01 \<Enter\></span> ORDER \#

You are taken into Screen Mode where you can edit the properties of the field, as shown in <u>Figure 120</u>:

<span id="_Ref343503280" class="anchor"></span>Figure 120: Creating Files and Fields—Example Using the Modify File Attributes Option in Screen Mode

Press \<PF1\>H for help Insert

Using the Screen Mode version of this option, after entering the field name or number (e.g., .01 field) after the “Select FIELD:” prompt, you are presented with a ScreenMan form (screen) that can be reviewed and edited like any other. In this example, the most important field on this screen is the DATA TYPE field in the upper right corner; it is a required entry. In this example, required entries in Screen Mode are indicated by a caption with a different color and an underline.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/112.png) NOTE: Screen Mode highlights the captions for required fields with an underline. However, depending on your terminal or terminal emulator software and your personal preferences, the form of the highlight can vary (e.g., some emulators highlight required field captions in reverse video, a different color, with an underline, or any combination of highlights).  
  
REF: For more information on ScreenMan forms and Screen Mode, see the “ScreenMan” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

In this case, the DATA TYPE field has been defined as NUMERIC and is *not editable* as indicated by the message displayed near the bottom of the screen (i.e., “NOTE THAT THIS FIELD’S DEFINITION IS NOT EDITABLE”); this is because a developer has previously edited the definition in a special way. However, unlike the DATA TYPE field, the value of the HELP-PROMPT field (i.e., “Enter the Order number.”), which is the message that is displayed to users when they enter a single question mark (?) while editing the ORDER \# field, can be edited. The DESCRIPTION and TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION fields are multi-line WORD-PROCESSING fields; to edit them, press the Enter key and a separate screen opens (i.e., a “popup” window). The DESCRIPTION is displayed to users who enter two question marks (??) while editing the ORDER \# field. The TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION, however, is for internal documentation only.

### Field Data Types

<span id="_Ref447598334" class="anchor"></span>Table 92: File Utilities—Traditional Cross-references

You are asked for the DATA TYPE field value for any field you are creating. You *must* pick one of these seventeen choices. Data validation checks are then asked depending on the DATA TYPE field value entered. For some data types, a default “HELP” prompt is automatically composed.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/113.png) NOTE: You can review and change a file’s field attributes easily by running the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option in Screen Mode.  
  
REF: For examples of entering a field attributes in Screen Mode, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

### DATE/TIME Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field defined as DATE/TIME allows you to enter a minimum and maximum date. You can also indicate whether the date can be entered with an imprecise date (e.g., JUL 1969) or with the time-of-day (e.g., JUL 20@4). VA FileMan does *not* accept dates *before*1700.

For example, when defining a DATA TYPE field value as DATE/TIME, you are asked the questions shown in <u>Figure 121</u>:

<span id="_Ref389634454" class="anchor"></span>Figure 121: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as DATE/TIME in Scrolling Mode (1 of 2)

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">DATE OF BIRTH</span>

REF: For an example of entering a DATA TYPE field value defined as DATE/TIME in Screen Mode, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

### NUMERIC Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field defined as NUMERIC requires you to enter the lowest and highest values allowed, the maximum number of decimal digits allowed, and to state whether dollar values are allowed (e.g., \$33).

For example, when defining a DATA TYPE field value as NUMERIC, you are asked the questions in <u>Figure 123</u>:

<span id="_Ref389634492" class="anchor"></span>Figure 123: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as NUMERIC in Scrolling Mode (1 of 2)

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">AGE AT ONSET</span>

A default help prompt is automatically written for you with the DATA TYPE field value of NUMERIC. You can change this prompt using the “Replace ... With” syntax.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/117.png) NOTE: This help information is displayed when the user inputs a single question mark (?) when editing this field.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/118.png) NOTE: You can review and change a file’s field attributes easily by running the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option in Screen Mode.  
  
REF: For an example of entering a DATA TYPE field value defined as NUMERIC in Screen Mode, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

### SET OF CODES Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field defined as a SET OF CODES can be used to restrict a user to just a few possible values (e.g., YES or NO). When defining a DATA TYPE field value of SET OF CODES, enter a valid code and a translation of what each code means. The user can enter the code, the full meaning, or a portion of the full meaning. If the field is set up to require only a one-character response (as shown in <u>Figure 125</u>), this data type can simplify the user’s data entry.

VA FileMan has only a limited amount of space to store the codes and their external values. If the limit is exceeded, you are told “TOO MUCH!!--SHOULD BE A ‘POINTER’, NOT ‘SET’.” The DATA TYPE field value of SET OF CODES is sometimes referred to as a SET.

For example, when defining a DATA TYPE field value as a SET OF CODES, you are asked questions shown in <u>Figure 125</u>:

<span id="_Ref349139780" class="anchor"></span>Figure 125: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as SET OF CODES in Scrolling Mode

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">SEX</span>

Are you adding 'SEX' as a new FIELD? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

DATA TYPE OF SEX: <span class="mark">SET \<Enter\></span> OF CODES

INTERNALLY-STORED CODE: <span class="mark">m \<Enter\></span> WILL STAND FOR: <span class="mark">MALE</span>

INTERNALLY-STORED CODE: <span class="mark">f \<Enter\></span> WILL STAND FOR: <span class="mark">FEMALE</span>

INTERNALLY-STORED CODE: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

WILL SEX FIELD BE MULTIPLE: No// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (No)

IS SEX ENTRY MANDATORY (Y/N): No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> YES

...

'HELP'-PROMPT: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DESCRIPTION:

1\> <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

In this example, “m” stands for Male and “f” stands for Female. Numbers as well as alphabetic characters can be used.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/119.png) NOTE: You can review and change a file’s field attributes easily by running the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option in Screen Mode.  
  
REF: For an example of entering a DATA TYPE field value defined as a SET OF CODES in Screen Mode, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

### FREE TEXT Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field defined as FREE TEXT allows you to enter the maximum and minimum allowable string length of the FREE TEXT data. You can also enter an M PATTERN MATCH that input data must match.

For example, when defining a DATA TYPE field value as FREE TEXT, you are asked the questions shown in <u>Figure 126</u>:

<span id="_Ref389634549" class="anchor"></span>Figure 126: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as FREE TEXT in Scrolling Mode (1 of 3)

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">DIAGNOSIS</span>

Are you adding 'DIAGNOSIS' as a new FIELD? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

DATA TYPE OF DIAGNOSIS: <span class="mark">FREE TEXT</span>

MINIMUM LENGTH: <span class="mark">3</span>

MAXIMUM LENGTH: <span class="mark">30</span>

(OPTIONAL) PATTERN MATCH (IN 'X'): <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

The PATTERN MATCH is written in M code. If input data violates the PATTERN MATCH or the Minimum/Maximum lengths, the data is *not* accepted, and the user is shown the help prompt information.

<span id="_Toc342980809" class="anchor"></span>Figure 127: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as FREE TEXT in Scrolling Mode (2 of 3)

WILL DIAGNOSIS FIELD BE MULTIPLE? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

IS DIAGNOSIS ENTRY MANDATORY(Y/N): NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> NO

SHOULD USER SEE AN "ADDING A NEW DIAGNOSIS?" MESSAGE FOR NEW

ENTRIES (Y/N): <span class="mark">N \<Enter\></span> NO

HAVING ENTERED OR EDITED ONE DIAGNOSIS, SHOULD USER BE ASKED

ANOTHER (Y/N): <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> YES

With these specifications, the user is *not* given a confirming message when new subentries are added to the Multiple. The user is allowed to enter several diagnoses in a row for a given patient.

REF: For an example of entering a DATA TYPE field value defined as FREE TEXT in Screen Mode, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

### WORD-PROCESSING Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field defined as WORD-PROCESSING allows entry of unlimited free-text data. The data can be edited, formatted, and printed with word-processing text editors.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/122.png) REF: For a description of VA FileMan’s native text editors, see the “Screen Editor” and “Line Editor” sections in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

For example, when defining a DATA TYPE field value as WORD-PROCESSING, you are asked the questions shown in <u>Figure 129</u>:

<span id="_Ref389634584" class="anchor"></span>Figure 129: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as WORD-PROCESSING in Scrolling Mode

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">HISTORY</span>

Are you adding 'HISTORY' as a new FIELD? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

DATA TYPE OF HISTORY: <span class="mark">WORD-PROCESSING</span>

SHALL THIS TEXT NORMALLY APPEAR IN WORD-WRAP MODE? Yes// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (Yes)

....

....

'HELP'-PROMPT: <span class="mark">SUBJECTIVE NARRATIVE OF PATIENT'S PROBLEM HISTORY</span>

DESCRIPTION:

1\> <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

If you answer YES to the “SHALL THIS TEXT NORMALLY APPEAR IN WORD-WRAP MODE” question, text is automatically wrapped at word boundaries to fit in the column in which it is being printed. Usually, this is the preferred way to print text.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/123.png) TIP: When it is important that lines of text be printed exactly as they were entered, answer NO to the “SHALL THIS TEXT NORMALLY APPEAR IN WORD-WRAP MODE” question. Thus, text is output in no-wrap mode. You would probably want a spreadsheet or a restaurant menu printed in no-wrap mode.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/124.png) NOTE: If the column in which no-wrap text is being printed is too short to accommodate the line of text, your printer can break the line in the middle of words or otherwise destroy the formatting of the text.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/125.png) NOTE: You can review and change a file’s field attributes easily by running the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option in Screen Mode.  
  
REF: For an example of entering a DATA TYPE field value defined as WORD-PROCESSING in Screen Mode, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

### COMPUTED Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When a DATA TYPE field is defined as COMPUTED, its value is determined at the time the field is accessed. This computation is based on an expression stored in the data dictionary. The field value (or data) itself is *not* stored in the data dictionary. The computed expression is constructed using field names, literals or constants, functions, and operators.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/126.png) REF: For a complete explanation of these elements, see the “<u>Computed Expressions</u>” section.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/127.png) NOTE: The functions referred to above are VA FileMan functions stored in the FUNCTION (#.5) file, *not* M functions. A developer with Programmer access can also enter M code in a COMPUTED field. The M code *must* set variable X to the COMPUTED field value.

For example, when defining a DATA TYPE field value as COMPUTED, you are asked the questions shown in <u>Figure 130</u>:

<span id="_Ref389634612" class="anchor"></span>Figure 130: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as COMPUTED in Scrolling Mode (1 of 2)

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">AGE</span>

Are you adding 'AGE' as a new FIELD? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

DATA TYPE OF AGE: <span class="mark">COMPUTED</span>

'COMPUTED-FIELD' EXPRESSION: <span class="mark">TODAY-(DATE OF BIRTH)\365.25</span>

....

NUMBER OF FRACTIONAL DIGITS TO OUTPUT (ONLY ANSWER IF NUMBER-VALUED): <span class="mark">2</span>

For this example (<u>Figure 130</u>), you assume the DATE OF BIRTH field was previously created. Thus, you can reference it in the “‘COMPUTED-FIELD’ EXPRESSION:” prompt. Also, the “NUMBER OF FRACTIONAL DIGITS TO OUTPUT (ONLY ANSWER IF NUMBER-VALUED):” prompt is asking whether you should enter the number of digits that should normally appear to the right of the decimal point when this field is displayed.

<span id="_Toc342980813" class="anchor"></span>Figure 131: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as COMPUTED in Scrolling Mode (2 of 2)

SHOULD VALUE ALWAYS BE INTERNALLY ROUNDED TO 2 DECIMAL PLACES? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

WHEN TOTALLING THIS FIELD, SHOULD THE SUM BE COMPUTED FROM

THE SUMS OF THE COMPONENT FIELDS? No// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (No)

LENGTH OF FIELD: 8// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/128.png) NOTE: You can review and change a file’s field attributes easily by running the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option in Screen Mode.  
  
REF: For an example of entering a DATA TYPE field defined as COMPUTED in Screen Mode, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

### POINTER TO A FILE Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field defined as a POINTER TO A FILE requires you to enter the name or number of the pointed-to file and that file *must* already exist (defined previously).

For example, when defining a DATA TYPE field value as POINTER TO A FILE, you are asked the questions shown in <u>Figure 132</u>:

<span id="_Ref389634646" class="anchor"></span>Figure 132: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as POINTER TO A FILE in Scrolling Mode (1 of 3)

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">RELIGION</span>

Are you adding 'RELIGION' as a new FIELD? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

DATA TYPE OF RELIGION: <span class="mark">POINTER \<Enter\></span> TO A FILE

POINT TO WHICH FILE: <span class="mark">RELIGION</span>

The pointed to file *must* already exist on your system. If you enter a single question mark (?) at the “POINT TO WHICH FILE:” prompt, you are presented with a list of the available files.

### VARIABLE-POINTER Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field defined as a VARIABLE-POINTER (as with the POINTER TO A FILE DATA TYPE) requires you to enter the names or numbers of the pointed-to files and those files *must* already exist (defined previously). Additionally, an order, message, and prefix *must* be associated with each file.

For example, when defining a DATA TYPE field value as VARIABLE-POINTER, you are asked the questions shown in <u>Figure 135</u>:

<span id="_Ref389634676" class="anchor"></span>Figure 135: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as VARIABLE-POINTER in Scrolling Mode (1 of 5)

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">PROVIDER</span>

Are you adding 'PROVIDER' as a new FIELD? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

DATA TYPE OF PROVIDER: <span class="mark">VARIABLE-POINTER</span>

Select VARIABLE POINTER: <span class="mark">PROVIDER</span>

You answer the “Select VARIABLE POINTER:” prompt with the name or number of an existing file.

<span id="_Toc342980818" class="anchor"></span>Figure 136: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as VARIABLE-POINTER in Scrolling Mode (2 of 5)

Are you adding 'PROVIDER' as a new VARIABLE-POINTER? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

VARIABLE-POINTER: PROVIDER// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

MESSAGE: <span class="mark">Staff Provider</span>

ORDER: <span class="mark">1</span>

PREFIX: <span class="mark">S</span>

SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW ENTRY: <span class="mark">NO \<Enter\></span> NO

The MESSAGE is part of the online help associated with the VARIABLE-POINTER field when a single question mark (?) is entered during editing. In this example, the PROVIDER file MESSAGE is associated with “Staff Provider.”

The several pointed-to files are searched based on their ORDER. In this example, since the ORDER for the PROVIDER VARIABLE-POINTER is one, the PROVIDER file is the first file searched.

The PREFIX field is used to reference a particular pointed-to file. To see the entries in a particular file, you would enter that file’s PREFIX followed by a period and a question mark at the VARIABLE-POINTER’s field name (e.g., in this example, entering “S.?” would give you the option to list the entries in the PROVIDER file). If you want to refer to only one of the several pointed-to files, put that file’s PREFIX followed by a period at the VARIABLE-POINTER’s field name (e.g., in this example, entering “S.” would refer you to the PROVIDER file).

By answering NO to the “SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW ENTRY:” prompt, the user is *not* allowed to add new entries on-the-fly to the PROVIDER file (the same as the RELIGION field entered as a POINTER TO A FILE). If you had answered YES, then new entries could be added to the PROVIDER file.

<span id="_Ref160545740" class="anchor"></span>Figure 137: Creating Files and Fields—Defining a DATA TYPE Field Value as VARIABLE-POINTER in Scrolling Mode (3 of 5)

Select VARIABLE-POINTER: <span class="mark">16 \<Enter\></span> PERSON

Are you adding 'PERSON' as a new VARIABLE-POINTER? (the 2ND)? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

VARIABLE-POINTER: PERSON// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

MESSAGE: <span class="mark">Other Provider</span>

ORDER: <span class="mark">2</span>

PREFIX: <span class="mark">O</span>

SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW ENTRY: <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span> YES

In this example (<u>Figure 137</u>), a second VARIABLE-POINTER was created to the (fictitious) PERSON (#16) file. By answering YES to the “SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW ENTRY:” prompt, users who are editing patient data are allowed to add entries to the (fictitious) PERSON file.

Select VARIABLE-POINTER: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

You stop identifying files for a VARIABLE-POINTER by simply pressing the Enter key without any additional entries at the “Select VARIABLE-POINTER:” prompt.

IS PROVIDER ENTRY MANDATORY (Y/N): NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> NO

'HELP'-PROMPT: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DESCRIPTION:

1\> <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

After entering both VARIABLE-POINTERs, when you enter a single question mark (?) at the “PROVIDER” field prompt, you see the help message shown in <u>Figure 140</u>:

<span id="_Ref389634706" class="anchor"></span>Figure 140: Creating Files and Fields—Example of Help Associated with a VARIABLE-POINTER Field

PROVIDER: <span class="mark">?</span>

Enter one of the following:

S.EntryName to select a Staff Provider

O.EntryName to select a Other Provider

To see the entries in any particular file type \<Prefix.?\>

In this example, if you simply enter a name at the “PROVIDER:” prompt, then the system searches each of the VARIABLE-POINTER field files for the name you have entered.

If a match is found, the system asks you if it is the correct entry. However, if you know the file the entry should be in, then you can speed processing by using the following syntax to select an entry:

- PREFIX.entry name
- MESSAGE.entry name
- File Name.entry name

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/130.png) NOTE: You do *not* need to enter the entire file name or message to direct the lookup. Using the first few characters suffices.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/131.png) NOTE: You can review and change a file’s field attributes easily by running the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option in Screen Mode.  
  
REF: For an example of entering a DATA TYPE field defined as a VARIABLE-POINTER in Screen Mode, see the “<u>Examples of File and Field Creation</u>” section.

### MUMPS Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Those with Programmer access can define a field with a DATA TYPE field value of MUMPS. This MUMPS-valued field is designed specifically to contain executable M code. The code entered into this kind of field is verified to be valid M code that conforms to VA programming standards.

DATA TYPE fields defined as MUMPS are usually used in files that are part of developer tools systems. For example, the OPTION (#19) file is part of the MENU MANAGEMENT system used in the VA for assigning menus and associated actions to each computer user. The ENTRY ACTION field on the OPTION (#19) file is defined as a DATA TYPE field of MUMPS. This field allows a developer who is creating an option to enter M code to do any setup and initialization that is needed before the end user can do the action allowed by the option.

### BOOLEAN Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A field defined as a BOOLEAN data type can have only two entry choices:

- YES
- NO

The internal values of the BOOLEAN data type are:

- 1—YES
- 0—NO

Example:

External: YES Internal: 1

External: NO Internal: 0

### LABEL REFERENCE Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A field defined as a LABEL REFERENCE data type is designed to store a tag and routine entry of the format, TAG^ROUTINE. It is stored as a FREE TEXT field.

Example:

External: TAG^ROUTINE Internal: TAG^ROUTINE

### TIME Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A field defined as a TIME data type can accept many of the DATE/TIME entries but only stores the TIME portion.

Example:

External: 15:09:43 Internal: 150943

### YEAR Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A field defined as a YEAR data type can accept many of the date entries but only stores the YEAR portion.

Example:

External: 2016 Internal: 3160000

### UNIVERSAL TIME Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A field defined as a UNIVERSAL TIME field can accept many of the DATE/TIME entries and stores the date/time in a format with the local time and includes an indicator showing the offset from Universal Time.

The first 14 characters of the internal storage of the UNIVERSAL TIME data type are exactly like the current DATE/TIME data type that includes seconds. The 3 characters in position 15, 16, and 17 indicate the UTC time offset in five (5) minute increments. In the example below: (440-500)/12=-5, this is a negative five hour offset from UTC.

Example:

External: JAN 6,2016@08:03:36 (UTC-5:00) Internal: 3160106.080336440

### FT POINTER Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A field defined as a FT POINTER field works like the POINTER data type but internally stores the free text that was returned from the pointed-to value.

Example:

External: PATCH,USER Internal: PATCH,USER

### FT DATE Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A field defined as a FT DATE field works like the DATE/TIME data type but internally stores the free text that was input by the user to determine the date.

Example:

External: T-1 Internal: T-1

### RATIO Data Type

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A field defined as a RATIO field is designed to accept two numbers with a colon (:) between the two numbers. It is formatted and stored like a mathematical ratio.

Example:

External: 1:14 Internal: 1:14

## Multiple-Valued Field (Multiples)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you create a DATA TYPE field value of any of the following:

- [DATE/TIME](#datetime-data-type-1)
- [NUMERIC](#numeric-data-type)
- [SET OF CODES](#set-of-codes-data-type)
- [FREE TEXT](#free-text-data-type)
- [POINTER TO A FILE](#pointer-to-a-file-data-type)
- [VARIABLE-POINTER](#variable-pointer-data-type)
- [BOOLEAN](#boolean-data-type)
- [LABEL REFERENCE](#label-reference-data-type)
- [TIME](#time-data-type)
- [YEAR](#year-data-type)
- [UNIVERSAL TIME](#universal-time-data-type)
- [FT POINTER](#ft-pointer-data-type)
- [FT DATE](#ft-date-data-type)
- [RATIO](#ratio-data-type)

After entering type-specific information, you are asked the following:

WILL FIELD BE MULTIPLE: NO//

Answering YES to this prompt means that:

- There can be more than one occurrence of a data value for this field in the entry (e.g., more than one DIAGNOSIS in a PATIENT \[#2\] file entry)
- Subfields can later be associated with this field (e.g., each DIAGNOSIS could have a DATE OF ONSET)

The “MULTIPLE:” prompt is *not* asked for DATA TYPE field values of WORD-PROCESSING, since, by definition, such types take Multiline values.

Two special questions are asked about Multiple-valued fields:

SHOULD USER SEE AN 'ADDING NEW ENTRY?' MESSAGE FOR NEW ENTRIES (Y/N)

Answering NO here means that the new Diagnosis (or whatever the Multiple is named) gets added *without* a verification prompt being asked.

HAVING ENTERED OR EDITED ONE, SHOULD USER BE ASKED ANOTHER (Y/N):

Answering either of the following:

- YES—User is prompted to put in several diagnoses, one right after the other.
- NO—User is *not* prompted to enter a second value.

## Making a Field Mandatory

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

For all DATA TYPE field values except COMPUTED, as you create the field, you are asked the following:

IS "*xxxxxxxx*" ENTRY MANDATORY (Y/N): NO//

The “*xxxxxxxx*” represents the name of the field. If you answer YES, the user of your file is *not* allowed to skip the field *without* entering data for a particular entry.

## Field Number Sequences

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

It is often useful to sequence the fields so that when you are using the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option and you ask to edit ALL fields, you will see the field questions presented in a natural order. If you want to add a CURRENT AGE (#2.5) field to the PATIENT (#2) file and place it between DATE OF BIRTH (#2) and RELIGION (#3), the dialog would be as shown in <u>Figure 141</u>:

<span id="_Ref160545897" class="anchor"></span>Figure 141: Creating Files and Fields—Example of “Sequencing” a Field

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">2.5</span>

Are you adding a new FIELD: No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

LABEL: <span class="mark">CURRENT AGE</span>

FIELD NUMBER: 2.5// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

You could have specified any number between two and three.

## NUMBER (.001) Field

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

All files have unique numbers associated with each of their entries. Defining the NUMBER field allows you to use the Internal Entry Number (IEN, also called the record number) as you would any other field. Usually, this means that someone (e.g., Herr Doktor, ONE FMPROVIDER, in the case of the \[fictitious\] MOZART WORK file) has gone to the trouble of creating a numbering scheme for the entries. To set up a file in which a unique Internal Entry Number is always matched with each entry name, you can create a field numbered .001 for the file:

<span id="_Ref452359320" class="anchor"></span>Figure 142: Creating Files and Fields—Creating a NUMBER (#.001) Field

Select FILE: <span class="mark">MOZART WORK</span>

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">.001</span>

Are you adding a new FIELD? No// <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

LABEL: <span class="mark">KOECHEL NUMBER</span>

FIELD NUMBER: .001// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DATA TYPE OF KOECHEL NUMBER: <span class="mark">NUMERIC</span>

INCLUSIVE LOWER BOUND: <span class="mark">1</span>

INCLUSIVE UPPER BOUND: <span class="mark">626</span>

IS THIS A DOLLAR AMOUNT (Y/N): NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FRACTIONAL DIGITS: 0// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

HELP PROMPT: Type a Number between 1 and 626, 0 Decimal Digits.

Replace <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DESCRIPTION:

1\> <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

The dialog in <u>Figure 143</u> is what would normally create a NUMERIC-valued field. In this case, you are describing the file’s PRIMARY KEY, or Internal Entry Number.

Once such a .001 field is defined, you can create a new file entry that might look like <u>Figure 143</u>:

<span id="_Ref160532078" class="anchor"></span>Figure 143: Creating Files and Fields—Example of Creating a New File Entry with a .001 Field Defined

Select MOZART WORK: <span class="mark">EINE KLEINE NACHTMUSIK</span>

Are you adding a new MOZART WORK? No// <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

KOECHEL NUMBER: <span class="mark">525</span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/132.png) NOTE: The PRIMARY KEY was added with VA FileMan 22.2.

More importantly, with a .001 field defined, an entry in the file can always be looked up by the Internal Entry Number (IEN), irrespective of any other cross-referencing that exists for the file, as shown in <u>Figure 144</u>:

<span id="_Ref160532192" class="anchor"></span>Figure 144: Creating Files and Fields—Looking Up an Entry in a File Using the IEN

Select MOZART WORK: <span class="mark">525 \<Enter\></span> EINE KLEINE NACHTMUSIK

Record Numbers *must* always be positive and canonic (i.e., they *cannot* contain alpha suffixes, leading Zeroes, or trailing fractional Zeroes).

Incidentally, the .001 field example (<u>Figure 142</u>) illustrates how using the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option can force a field to have a particular number (.001 in this case). It is done by entering the new Number first, and then the new Label.

### Forced Lookups Using Numbers

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Number-meaningful lookups can be forced by prefixing the numeric input with the \` (grave accent). If FMPATIENT,FIVE’s Internal Entry Number (IEN) in the PATIENT (#2) file is 355, they could be identified as shown in <u>Figure 145</u>:

<span id="_Ref160545967" class="anchor"></span>Figure 145: Creating Files and Fields—Looking Up an Entry in a File Using the FMPATIENT,FIVE’s IEN

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">\`355 \<Enter\></span> FMPATIENT,FIVE

If the .01 field of a file is a pointer to another file, an entry can be looked up by prefacing the IEN of the entry in the pointed-to file with \`\` (double grave accent). For example, the .01 field of the PATIENT ALLERGIES (#120.8) file is a pointer to the PATIENT (#2) file. If the IEN of PATIENT (#2) file entry FMPATIENT,ONE is 4, then you could choose the PATIENT ALLERGIES (#120.8) file entry that points to FMPATIENT,ONE, as shown in <u>Figure 146</u>:

<span id="_Ref490046371" class="anchor"></span>Figure 146: Creating Files and Fields—Looking Up an Entry in a File Using the FMPATIENT,ONE’s IEN

Output from what File: PATIENT ALLERGIES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (4 entries)

Select PATIENT ALLERGIES: <span class="mark">\`\`4 \<Enter\></span> FMPATIENT,ONE 3-3-60

## Changing and Deleting Fields

- <u>Changing Field Attributes</u>
- <u>Changing a Field’s DATA TYPE Value</u>
- <u>Deleting an Existing Field</u>

### Changing Field Attributes

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

After creating a field in a file, you can return to change or delete the field within the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option, simply by entering the field name (or number) when asked:

Select FIELD:

When you return to the field in this option, you can change the field’s:

- Label (Name)
- Title (long form of its name)
- Audit and Audit Conditions (to indicate which fields should be audited)
- Read/Delete/Write
- Source
- Destination
- Group
- Description of the field, a WORD-PROCESSING field (what the user sees after entering two question marks)
- Technical Description

After you are presented with these attributes of the field, you can change the attributes defined during the initial definition of the field as described in the “<u>Creating Fields</u>” section.

For example, say you have created an SSN field (Social Security Number) in the PATIENT (#2) file and would now like to edit the field:

<span id="_Toc342980827" class="anchor"></span>Figure 147: Editing a Field—LABEL, TITLE, and AUDIT Attributes

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">SSN</span>

LABEL: SSN// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Select DESTINATION: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Select GROUP: <span class="mark">DEMOG</span>

A GROUP is a shorthand way for the user to refer to several fields at once when using the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] or the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] options. Here, SSN is being assigned to the DEMOG group.

<span id="_Toc342980830" class="anchor"></span>Figure 150: Editing a Field—DESCRIPTION Attributes

The DESCRIPTION and TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION attributes document the use and meaning of the field. The information in DESCRIPTION is shown to the user when two question marks are entered at the “EDIT Option:” prompt. When initially creating a field, you are prompted for the DESCRIPTION field after the ‘HELP’-PROMPT. The TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION is displayed only when the data dictionary is printed.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/135.png) NOTE: Prior to VA FileMan 21.0 you were allowed to enter a Help Frame for field documentation; that attribute is no longer supported.

Enter 9 numbers without dashes, e.g., 666456789.

To illustrate the use of GROUPs, add the NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, and SEX fields into the DEMOG group:

<span id="_Toc342980832" class="anchor"></span>Figure 152: Editing a Field—Adding Fields to a GROUP (1 of 2)

DATE OF BIRTH: JAN 3, 1955// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

### Changing a Field’s DATA TYPE Value

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Within the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option, you can change the DATA TYPE field value itself. There are limitations on the sort of changes you can make. These are listed below.

You *must* be very careful in making such changes if you already have file data entered, because there is no guarantee that the old data matches the newly specified criteria (e.g., field length). However, if you do change a field definition, you are asked if you want existing data checked for inconsistencies. A list of any discrepancies is printed. If more than one discrepancy is found, you can save the list of discrepant entries in a template. To generate this list later, use the Verify Fields \[DIVERIFY\] option on the Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu.

The following restrictions apply to changing the definitions of existing DATA TYPE field values in a file:

- Multiple-valued fields *cannot* be changed to single-valued fields or vice versa. Multiple-valued fields can only be defined when creating a field.
- COMPUTED fields *cannot* be changed to other types of fields or vice versa.
- WORD-PROCESSING-type fields should only be changed into Multiple-valued FREE TEXT fields.
- Only a Multiple-valued FREE TEXT field can be changed into a WORD-PROCESSING field, and only if no other subfields are defined for that field.
- POINTER TO A FILE type fields *cannot* be changed to VARIABLE-POINTER type fields or vice versa.

### Deleting an Existing Field

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Deleting a field and its definition is done by deleting the field Name (LABEL). Delete the field by typing the at-sign (@) after the display of a field’s LABEL when using the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option:

<span id="_Toc342980834" class="anchor"></span>Figure 154: Editing a Field—Deleting a Field and its Definition

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">MOD \<Enter\></span> ify File Attributes

Do you want to use the screen-mode version? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

MODIFY WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">SEX</span>

LABEL: SEX// <span class="mark">@</span>

SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE 'SEX' FIELD? <span class="mark">YES</span>

OK TO DELETE 'SEX' FIELDS IN THE EXISTING ENTRIES? <span class="mark">YES</span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/136.png) CAUTION: If you answer NO to the “OK TO DELETE” question, data conflicts can occur in the future, if you create new fields. It is advisable to always delete existing entries. Only a developer can delete the entries after you have answered NO.

### File Creation

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Figure 155</u> illustrates the file definition dialog you see when creating a new file using the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option. In this case, you create the ORDER (#100) file (a standard VA FileMan file):

<span id="_Ref389631230" class="anchor"></span>Figure 155: Modify File Attributes Option—Creating a File

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">MOD \<Enter\></span> ify File Attributes

Do you want to use the screen-mode version? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

MODIFY WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">ORDER</span>

Are you adding 'ORDER' as a new FILE? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

FILE NUMBER: 99000// <span class="mark">100</span>

...SORRY, HOLD ON...

A FreeText NAME Field (#.01) has been created.

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME</span>

VA FileMan prompts you to enter the file name. If it is a new file, VA FileMan asks you to confirm that you want to add a new file. The default file number to the left of the // (e.g., 99000) is related to a site number that is assigned to your computer when VA FileMan is initialized. This file number is within the range of numbers assigned to your site. Be sure to follow local policies when assigning file numbers.

As you can see from this example (<u>Figure 155</u>), when a file is created a field with the label NAME and number .01 is automatically created. When creating a new file, you can change the definition of this field in the same way you can change the definition of any other field.

When you select a field (e.g., the NAME field), you are taken into a ScreenMan form where you can edit the properties of the field, as shown in <u>Figure 156</u>:

In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a “popup” window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent to its specific DATA TYPE field value. FREE TEXT-type fields require input for the “MINIMUM” and “MAXIMUM” lengths of the field. In this example, users *must* enter from 1 to 80 characters for this field.

If included, the PATTERN MATCH *must* be written in M. For example, you can ensure that the data value does *not* start with a punctuation character by entering a PATTERN MATCH of:

X'?1P.E

This is a good check to make on a field that is allowed to be just one character in length. Sometimes, users can mistype and answer a field prompt with “/” (same key as ?) or some other meaningless punctuation character. A PATTERN MATCH check such as “X’?1P.E” keeps that kind of mistake out of your database.

#### Carets (^) in a FREE TEXT Field

If you are going to have carets (^) in a FREE TEXT-type field, it is advisable to create the field on a node by itself. You should create the field as usual, but when VA FileMan asks for the ^-PIECE POSITION, reply with E1,*\<maximum length\>*, as shown in <u>Figure 163</u>.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/139.png) NOTE: Putting multiple fields on the same node where some of the fields use the Em,n format may cause the inclusion of padding when displaying the data.

In Screen Mode, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a “popup” window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent to its specific DATA TYPE field value. With VARIABLE-POINTER-type fields, VA FileMan asks you to enter the pointed-to file name and its order in the first “popup” window. In this case, the first VARIABLE-POINTER file entered was the OPTION (#19) file, which would already have to exist. The ORDER was also set to one. When you press the Enter key at the “ORDER” prompt for each VARIABLE-POINTER, there is an additional “popup” window (i.e., a “popup window within the popup window”). The additional questions pertaining to the VARIABLE-POINTER file you are currently entering appear in this secondary “popup” window.

As you can see in this example, the OPTION (#19) file’s MESSAGE, is associated with “PROTOCOL.” Since its ORDER is one, it is the first file searched. The PREFIX “MISC” can also be used to refer to the OPTION (#19) file. Just as with the WHO ENTERED POINTER TO A FILE field (previously described), users *cannot* add new options to the OPTION (#19) file on-the-fly when they are entering an ITEM ORDERED in the ORDER file because the “SHOULD USER BE ALLOWED TO ADD A NEW ENTRY:” prompt is NO.

A Multiple field is created just as any other, except that the “IS THIS FIELD MULTIPLE...” question is answered YES. In Screen Mode, after answering YES to this question, a “popup” window appears containing editable attributes pertinent to a Multiple field. With Multiple-type fields, VA FileMan asks if you want users to be notified when they are adding new entries and if users should be asked if they want to make another entry. In this case, the user answered NO to both questions.

#### Subfields

To create or edit Subfields of a Multiple field, select a Multiple-valued field (e.g., the RESPONSES Multiple field, created in Section <u>10.8.17</u>):

In Screen Mode, after entering a Multiple field, a special screen appears that displays information about the Multiple as a whole.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/152.png) NOTE: If you wanted to delete the entire Multiple field, you would enter an at-sign (@) at the “MULTIPLE-FIELD LABEL” prompt.

After viewing this screen, you can proceed to add fields to the Multiple or to edit existing Subfields. This is done at the “Select *\<FIELD NAME\>* SUB-FIELD:” prompt that is displayed when you exit Screen Mode (see <u>Figure 184</u>).

#### Numeric Subfield

After selecting a Multiple-valued field (e.g., the RESPONSES Multiple field in the ORDER \[#100\] file), you can enter or modify the Multiple’s subfields by entering the field’s number or name (label) at the “Select *\<FIELD NAME\>* SUB-FIELD:” prompt (where *\<FIELD NAME\>* represents the name of the Multiple field).

A .01 field with the same name as the Multiple field was added automatically when the field was identified as a Multiple. The .01 field is the identifying key for an entry in the Subfile (Multiple); it is like a file’s .01 field, which is the file’s identifying key. In <u>Figure 184</u>, the .01 subfield is edited to have a DATA TYPE of NUMERIC:

In Screen Mode, while editing a sub-field of a Multiple, you notice that the heading at the top of the screen reminds you that you are now editing a field within a Multiple (e.g., “Field \#.01 in Sub-File \#100.045 of File \#100”).

Also, whenever the DATA TYPE field is editable, a “popup” window appears, containing editable attributes of the field that are pertinent to its specific DATA TYPE field value. With NUMERIC-type fields, VA FileMan asks you to enter the following:

- INCLUSIVE LOWER BOUND (e.g., set to 1)
- INCLUSIVE UPPER BOUND (e.g., set to 9999999).
- IS THIS A DOLLAR AMOUNT: You are asked if the numeric value is a dollar amount (e.g., set to NO).
- MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FRACTIONAL DIGITS: If decimal digits are allowed (e.g., set to 0).

A default help prompt is automatically written for you with the DATA TYPE field of NUMERIC. In this case, the following English message was built automatically based on the specifications entered by the user:

Type a Number between 1 and 9999999, 0 Decimal Digits

As always, you can accept the default help prompt or change it using the Replace ... With syntax.

# File Utilities

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Various file utilities are provided as options on the VA FileMan’s Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/154.png) NOTE: Some additional functionality for modifying files is contained in the separate Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option, which is located on the main VA FileMan \[DIUSER\] menu.

## Verify Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Verify Fields \[DIVERIFY\] option uses a field’s definition to verify the data stored in a file. After invoking this option, you can ask to verify all existing values of a particular field by entering its label at the “VERIFY WHICH FIELD:” prompt; or you can ask that *all* fields at a given file level be verified by entering ALL at the prompt.

In addition to checking the validity of the data stored in a file, Verify Fields checks the cross-references on the file’s data. Among the items checked for are:

- Dangling pointers in cross-references.
- Cross-reference values exceeding 30 characters if a field’s Label has been translated into the user’s language, the report of errors for that field will show the translated Label.

If more than one discrepancy is found between the current definition and the data on file, you are asked if you want to save the list of those entries containing the inconsistent data in a template. Later, you would be able to “SORT BY:” the entries in this template to display or edit them.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/155.png) REF: For information on how to execute or avoid executing any part of the INPUT transform when the Verify Fields \[DIVERIFY\] option is being run, see the “Input Transform” section in the “Advanced File Definition” section in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.  
  
> **NOTE:** Some parts of a field’s INPUT transform (whose main purpose is to validate data as a user enters it) may be inappropriate when being executed in the context of the Verify Fields \[DIVERIFY\] option.

> **NOTE:** The “DISPLAY OPTION?” field for the Verify Fields \[DIVERIFY\] option *must* be set to “YES” to display a final “Press RETURN to continue” at the end of the report.

## Cross-Reference a Field or File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Traditional Cross-References:

- Types of Traditional Cross-references
- Edit a Traditional Cross-reference
- Create a Traditional Cross-reference
- Delete a Traditional Cross-reference

New-Style Cross-References:

- Edit a New-Style Cross-reference
- Create a New-Style Cross-reference
- Delete a New-Style Cross-reference

There are seven types of Traditional cross-references and two types of New-Style cross-references available. Generally, a cross-reference in VA FileMan specifies that some action is performed when the field’s value is entered, changed, or deleted. For several types of cross-references, the action consists of putting the value into a list (i.e., an index used when looking up an entry or when sorting). The regular cross-reference is used for sorting and for lookup; you can limit it to sorting only. The Key Word in Context (KWIC), mnemonic, and SOUNDEX cross-references are also used for lookup.

You can sort a file on any field (except a WORD-PROCESSING-type field) whether a cross-reference exists for the field. However, sorting is done more quickly and efficiently if a regular cross-reference exists on the field.

When a file is created, a Traditional cross-reference on the NAME (#.01) field is automatically established. You can add or delete cross-references at any time using the Cross-Reference a Field or File \[DIXREF\] option located on the Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu. This option can also be used to enter a description of a cross-reference and to prevent the cross-reference from being deleted.

You can create a cross-reference on a Multiple field, a Multiple’s subfields, or on any other field type except a WORD-PROCESSING-type field. For example, the PATIENT (#2) file contains the AGE AT ONSET subfield in the DIAGNOSIS Multiple. If you create a regular cross-reference for a field in a Multiple, you can choose in what context the cross-reference is used. You might want to cross-reference the whole file by AGE AT ONSET (so that a report sorted by AGE AT ONSET could be produced efficiently). Alternately, you might want to cross-reference only an individual patient’s diagnoses by onset age (so that a lookup of diagnosis could be done using AGE AT ONSET).

### New-Style Cross-References

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Two types of New-Style cross-references are available: Regular and MUMPS. They are like their Traditional cross-reference counterparts, but New-Style cross-references offer some unique advantages:

- Compound Cross-references—You can create not only *simple cross-references* that are based on a single field, but *compound cross-references*, cross-references that are based on more than one field in a file. For example, in a regular New-Style “C” index you can store both the Name and ID Number of a record as subscripts in a single index:

^DIZ(1000,"C","FMPATIENT,25","A56789",14) =^DIZ(1000,"C","FMPATIENT,10","D1234",5) =

To create this kind of index with a Traditional cross-reference, you would have to create two MUMPS-type cross-references, one on the NAME field and one on the ID Number field. New-Style cross-references allow you to define this compound cross-reference once as a regular index that VA FileMan can use for lookup and sorting.

- Field- or Record-Level Execution—Since a Traditional cross-reference is defined on a particular field, the action associated with that cross-reference is performed whenever the field is edited. With New-Style cross-references, you can specify that the action associated with a cross-reference is performed only once after the entire record has been edited, typically at the end of the editing session. Record-level execution would normally be selected for compound cross-references.

If the “C” index in the example above were defined using Traditional MUMPS-type cross-references, and both the NAME and ID Number fields were contained in a single INPUT template, the index would be updated when the NAME field was edited, and then again when the ID Number was edited. But if the cross-reference were defined as a New-Style compound index with record-level execution, the index would be updated only once after the entire record was edited, after changes to both the NAME and ID Number fields had been completed.

- Code to Kill the Entire Index—This is code that VA FileMan can execute to remove an entire index from a file. This can make re-indexing a file much more efficient. To delete an index, VA FileMan can execute the *Kill Entire Index Code*, instead of looping through all the record in a file and removing each record’s index one at a time.
- Activity—New-Style cross-references can have an Activity of “R” and/or “I” to allow you to control whether the cross-reference should be fired during Reindexing and/or Installation (KIDS). If you call IX^DIK, IX1^DIK, or IXALL^DIK or if you select the Re-Index File \[DIRDEX\] option located on VA FileMan’s Utility Functions menu \[DIUTILITY\] to re-index all cross-references, only those New-Style cross-references that contain an “R” in Activity are fired.

If you explicitly select a cross-reference in an EN^DIK, EN1^DIK, or ENALL^DIK call or in the Re-Index File \[DIRDEX\] option on VA FileMan’s Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu, that cross-reference is fired regardless of its Activity. Also, when a field is edited, VA FileMan ignores Activity and fires all cross-references on that field; though, you can control whether a cross-reference is fired by entering Set and Kill Conditions.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/158.png) REF: For more information on the Re-Index File \[DIRDEX\] option and limiting re-indexing on some files, see the “<u>Re-Index File Option</u>” and “<u>Limits on Reindexing Files</u>” sections.

- Collation—You can specify forwards or backwards collation, the direction in which VA FileMan’s lookup utilities loop through a subscript in an index when entries are returned or displayed to the user. This is especially useful for dates. Developers can store dates in their natural internal VA FileMan date format and still display entries in the date index in reverse date order.
- Lookup Prompt—Each subscript on an index in the INDEX (#.11) file can be assigned a LOOKUP PROMPT. This prompt is used as the prompt for entry of the lookup value during classic VA FileMan lookup ^DIC calls. If *not* filled in, VA FileMan defaults to use the name of the field for that subscript value, if there is one.
- Computed Values—Those with Programmer access can have any value in the cross-reference be computed; the value is determined from M code that sets the variable X.
- Subscript Transforms—Those with Programmer access can define the following on subscripts in an index:
- Transform for Storage—Code that transforms the internal value of a field before it is stored as a subscript in the index.
- Transform for Display—Code that transforms the value stored in the index back to a form that can be displayed to the user.
- SET and Kill Conditions—Those with Programmer access can enter M code that specifies whether the SET or KILL logic is fired. The M code sets the variable X to Boolean true only if the logic should be executed. The “before” and “after” values are available in the X, X1, and X2 arrays (see <u>Table 93</u>).
- The X, X1, and X2 Arrays—Those with Programmer access can reference the X, X1, and X2 arrays in the SET and KILL logic and the SET and KILL conditions of New-Style cross-references. When a field is edited and the cross-reference logic is executed, the field’s corresponding X1 array element contains the old value of the field, the X2 array element contains the new value of the field, and the X array element contains either the old or new value, depending on whether the SET logic, SET condition, KILL logic, or KILL condition is being executed:

| Array          | Value in KILL Logic/KILL Condition | Value in SET Logic/SET Condition |
|----------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| X(order#)  | Old value                          | New value                        |
| X1(order#) | Old value                          | Old value                        |
| X2(order#) | New value                          | New value                        |

<span id="_Toc342980892" class="anchor"></span>Table 94: Auditing—“AUDIT” Prompt Response

The variables X, X1, and X2 always equal X(1), X1(1), and X2(1), respectively.

If an order number in the cross-reference refers to the .01 field, X1(order#) is set to NULL when the SET logic and SET condition are executed during record creation. Similarly, X2(order#) is set to NULL when the KILL logic or condition are executed during record deletion.

- Key Support—A regular New-Style index can be used as the Uniqueness Index for a key. VA FileMan ensures that all fields in a Uniqueness Index have values (are *not*NULL), and that those values, taken collectively, are unique across all records in the file.

## Identifier

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/164.png) NOTE: If you want to uniquely identify an entry in your file by a combination of fields, and to force that uniqueness, then you most likely want to create a KEY on your file, rather than using Identifier fields (which do *not* force uniqueness). If a field is part of the PRIMARY KEY for a file, then it should *not* be marked as an Identifier as well.  
  
REF: For more information on creating a KEY, see the “<u>Key Definition</u>” section.

An identifier is a designation you can give to a field that you want *permanently* associated with the .01 field (NAME) of a file. The SSN field of our PATIENT file example has been defined as an identifier field. Each time a patient’s entry is referenced, the SSN is displayed to help positively identify the entry. When a new entry is added to the file, the user is asked to provide the SSN.

A field that is *not* multiple-valued can be specified as an identifier for a file simply by using the Identifier \[DIIDENT\] option available on the Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu.

A multiple-valued field *cannot* be designated as an identifier; however, a subfield of that multiple-valued field *can* be designated as an identifier for the Multiple. The DIAGNOSIS field in the PATIENT file *cannot*, for example, be designated as an identifier, but its subfield AGE AT ONSET can be designated as an identifier of DIAGNOSIS. This feature is discussed in more detail later in this section.

These are the steps for setting up the sample SSN field as an identifier:

<span id="_Toc342980869" class="anchor"></span>Figure 195: File Utilities—Example of Setting a Field as an Identifier

MODIFY WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">SSN</span>

Want to make 'SSN' an identifier? NO// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

Want to display SSN whenever a lookup is done

on an entry in the 'PATIENT' file? YES // <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (YES)

Here, the positive answer to the last question causes the patient’s SSN value to show up whenever a lookup on a patient is done. For example:

<span id="_Toc342980870" class="anchor"></span>Figure 196: File Utilities—Example of an Identifier Field Displayed When Doing a Lookup

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT</span>

1 FMPATIENT,25 000223333

2 FMPATIENT,29 000114444

CHOOSE 1-2:

An identifier field is *not* asked if its WRITE access security does *not* match the VA FileMan Access Code of the user. If the identifier field has been specified (in the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option) as a required field, the user *must* type a valid answer to its prompt when it is asked as an identifier; otherwise, the entry just created is deleted.

Using the caret key (^) for jumping is *not* allowed for identifier fields in the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option when adding a new entry. If you attempt to use the caret key in a field designated as an identifier in an edit session, the entry just created is deleted. Since the SSN field in our example is mandatory and an identifier, this ensures that every patient in our PATIENT file has an SSN recorded.

As mentioned above, you could make the AGE AT ONSET subfield an identifier for the DIAGNOSIS field Multiple as follows:

<span id="_Toc342980871" class="anchor"></span>Figure 197: File Utilities—Example of a Subfield as an Identifier

Select UTILITY OPTION: <span class="mark">IDEN \<Enter\></span> TIFIER

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">DIAG \<Enter\></span> NOSIS (multiple)

Select DIAGNOSIS SUB-FIELD: <span class="mark">AGE AT ONSET</span>

Want to make 'AGE AT ONSET' an Identifier? NO// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

Want to display AGE AT ONSET whenever a lookup is done

on an entry in the 'DIAGNOSIS' file? YES// <span class="mark">N \<Enter\></span> (NO)

As a result of this dialog, every time a new DIAGNOSIS for a patient is entered, the AGE AT ONSET would be asked. The AGE AT ONSET would *not*, however, be automatically displayed at subsequent DIAGNOSIS lookups.

To drop a field’s status as an identifier, simply return to the Identifier \[DIIDENT\] option, select the field, and answer YES to the question:

<span id="_Toc342980872" class="anchor"></span>Figure 198: File Utilities—Deleting an Identifier Field

Field is already an Identifier; want to delete it? NO// <span class="mark">Y</span>

## Re-Index File Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Use the Re-Index File \[DIRDEX\] option when you create a new cross-reference on a field that already contains data, and you want to reindex the file. The dialog shown in <u>Figure 199</u> is presented when reindexing a file:

<span id="_Ref389634899" class="anchor"></span>Figure 199: File Utilities—Sample Dialog When Re-Indexing a File

DO YOU WISH TO RE-CROSS-REFERENCE ONE PARTICULAR INDEX? NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

OK, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO KILL OFF THE EXISTING INDEX? NO// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

DO YOU THEN WANT TO 'RE-CROSS-REFERENCE'? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

All the cross-references for the file are fired except for bulletins. This dialog executes triggers and MUMPS cross-references.

If a file contains more than one cross-reference, you can get a list of them by entering a single question mark (?) in response to the “DO YOU WISH TO RE-CROSS-REFERENCE ONE PARTICULAR INDEX?” prompt. You can then reindex a single cross-reference or all of cross-references.

### Limits on Reindexing Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

There are some files that should *not* be reindexed! When those files are inadvertently reindexed, it can cause major problems and necessitate restores from backups. Currently, there is no way to prevent such files from being reindexed, except for putting “DO NOT RE-INDEX” in the file description, which is ineffective. The Re-Index File \[DIRDEX\] option is a powerful, useful tool, but it can cause a lot of damage when one is *not* paying attention.

Patch DI\*22\*167 allows individual cross-references to be marked “Do Not Re-Index,” and the Re-Index File \[DIRDEX\] option respects that. APIs that perform reindexing also respect that, with the following exceptions:

- APIs that reindex a single record ignore the no-reindex restriction, which includes the following APIs:
- EN^DIK
- EN1^DIK
- EN2^DIK
- IX^DIK
- IX1^DIK
- IX2^DIK
- A cross-reference is reindexed if it is specifically named in an API call, regardless of whether it is marked “Do Not Re-Index,” which includes the following APIs:
- ENALL^DIK
- ENALL2^DIK

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/165.png) REF: For more information on these APIs, see the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

Traditional regular cross-references (e.g., B and C cross-references) are always reindexed, and *cannot* be marked “Do Not Re-Index.” All other cross-references can be marked “Do Not Re-Index,” because reindexing them might cause problems.

The following cross-reference types can be marked “Do Not Re-Index:”

- All New-Style cross-references
- Bulletin cross-references
- MUMPS cross-references
- Trigger cross-references

To mark a cross-reference “Do Not Re-Index,” use the Cross-Reference a Field or File \[DIXREF\] option under the Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/166.png) CAUTION: “Do Not Re-Index” can only be undone by KILLing the “NOREINDEX” node in the DD.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/167.png) REF: For more information on the Cross-Reference a Field or File \[DIXREF\] option, see the “<u>Cross-Reference a Field or File</u>” section.

## INPUT Transform (Syntax)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you have Programmer access, you can edit a field’s INPUT transform or syntax checker. You can also set the Maximum Length for a field’s output.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/168.png) REF: For a detailed description of the INPUT transform, see the “Input Transforms” section in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

## Edit File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Edit File \[DIEDFILE\] option available on the VA FileMan Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu displays the various attributes of a file you specify in Screen Mode (i.e., invokes a ScreenMan form).

<u>Figure 200</u> is an example using the Edit File option with the ORDER (#100) file in Screen Mode:

You can use the Edit File \[DIEDIT\] option to:

- Edit the Name of a File—Edit the file name at the “FILE NAME:” prompt.
- Delete a File—If you enter an at-sign (@) at the “FILE NAME:” prompt, you are given the choice of deleting the *entire file* and its data attribute dictionary (including all templates and file definitions) or just deleting the *current individual entries in the file*. However, you *cannot* delete a file that is pointed to by another file.
- Enter or Edit the Description of a File—You can enter or edit the word-processing text description for documenting the file at the “DESCRIPTION...” prompt. This description appears in the Standard, Modified Standard, and Global Map format data dictionary listings.
- Enter or Edit the Application Group—You can enter or edit the Application Group at the “Select APPLICATION GROUP:” prompt. Enter a namespace (from 2 to 4 characters) indicating a package accessing this file.
- Enter or Edit the Developer’s Name—You can enter or edit the name of the package developer at the “DEVELOPER:” prompt. Entering two question marks (??) lets you choose from a list of names.
- Enter or Edit the File Access Parameters—You can enter or edit the security access to a file by making entries at any of the following prompts:
- “DATA DICTIONARY ACCESS:”
- “READ ACCESS:”
- “WRITE ACCESS:”
- “DELETE ACCESS:”
- “LAYGO ACCESS:”
- “AUDIT ACCESS:”

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/169.png) REF: File security is fully explained in the “<u>Data Security</u>” section.

- Turn Auditing On/Off for a File’s Data Dictionary—If you want to turn auditing on for data dictionary changes, enter YES at the “DD AUDIT:” prompt. Answer NO, if you do *not* want to audit data dictionary changes.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/170.png) REF: Auditing is fully explained in the “<u>Auditing</u>” section.

- Ask/Do Not Ask Users to Confirm Their Entry Selection—If you want users who select an entry in a file (for any lookup purpose) to confirm their entry selection by answering positively at the “…OK?” prompt, answer YES at the “ASK ‘OK’ WHEN LOOKING UP AN ENTRY:” prompt. If you do *not* want users to confirm their entry selection, answer NO at the “ASK ‘OK’ WHEN LOOKING UP AN ENTRY:” prompt. The default is NO.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/171.png) TIP: Use this feature on files containing many similar or confusingly named entries (e.g., files for drugs).

- Enter a File Screen—A line of MUMPS code can be entered here. It should set the \$T switch TRUE or FALSE. At the time of execution Y is the number of a file entry, which you want to FILTER for lookup. Thus, this code is a ‘permanent DIC(“S”)’ for the file.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/172.png) CAUTION: Misuse of this can disenable the file!

For example, this is the file screen for the NEW PERSON (#200) file: I \$\$SCR200^XUSER.

- Enter or Edit a Post-Selection Action (only available when you have Programmer access)—If you have Programmer access, you can write M code for a Post-Selection Action, for entries in this file.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/173.png) REF: Post-Selection Action is explained in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

- Enter a Lookup Routine (only available when you have Programmer access)—If you have Programmer access, you also can enter an existing lookup routine. To do this, enter a routine namespace (from 3 to 6 characters, no ^) at the “LOOK-UP PROGRAM:” prompt. The name you choose for the lookup routine *must* be a routine currently on the system. This special lookup routine is executed instead of the standard VA FileMan lookup logic, whenever a call is made to ^DIC.
- Specify that Cross-references on a File Should be Compiled (only available when you have Programmer access)—If you have Programmer access, you also can specify that cross-references on a file should be compiled. To do this, enter a routine namespace (from 3 to 6 characters, no ^) at the “CROSS-REFERENCE ROUTINE:” prompt. This becomes the namespace of the compiled routines. If a *new* routine name is entered, but the cross-references are *not* compiled currently, the routine name is automatically deleted.

To stop the use of the compiled cross-references, enter an at-sign (@) at the “CROSS-REFERENCE ROUTINE:” prompt. At this point, the cross-references are considered uncompiled, and VA FileMan does *not* use the routine for re-indexing. If you decide later to recompile the cross-references, you are shown the routine name previously used so that you can easily reuse the same routine name. Stopping the use of the compiled cross-reference does *not* delete the compiled routines. If you want, you can delete those routines manually.

## OUTPUT Transform

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Sometimes, you might want to display a field differently from the way in which it is stored. For example, a Social Security Number can be entered and stored as nine digits, but you may want it to always be displayed with punctuating hyphens. The Output Transform \[DIOTRAN\] option allows you to make this kind of specification by associating with any field a computed expression that operates on the value of that field

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/174.png) REF: For details about using M code in an OUTPUT transform, see the “OUTPUT Transform” topic in the “Advanced File Definition” section in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

If you want the SSN field to always appear with inserted dashes, answer the prompts as shown in In <u>Figure 202</u>:

<span id="_Ref160542677" class="anchor"></span>Figure 202: File Utilities—Example of Creating an OUTPUT Transform

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">UTI \<Enter\></span> LITIES

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">SSN</span>

SSN OUTPUT TRANSFORM: <span class="mark">\$E(SSN,1,3)\_"-"\_\$E(SSN,4,5)\_"-"\_\$E(SSN,6,9)</span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/175.png) REMEMBER:

- The transform does *not* apply when you are inputting data; thus, do *not* enter the dashes when using the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option.
- To retrieve the internal, stored value of a field that has an OUTPUT transform, you can refer to the INTERNAL(SSN) function.
- The internal form of the date is automatically invoked when you are sorting by a DATE/TIME valued field.

## Template Edit

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Template Edit option available on the VA FileMan Utility Functions menu \[DIUTILITY\] is used to edit each of the three types of VA FileMan templates:

- INPUT
- PRINT
- SORT

For each template type, a *two*-screen ScreenMan form is used. This allows you to edit templates in Screen Mode.

The *first* screen of the pair allows you to change the access privileges of the template you are editing:

- READ ACCESS—This access controls which class of users \[i.e., DUZ(0)\] get to *use* the template.
- WRITE ACCESS—This access controls which class of users gets to *change* the template.

The *first* screen also allows you to enter a DESCRIPTION for the purpose of documenting what the template does. This DESCRIPTION is printed on a “TEMPLATES ONLY” data dictionary list, and in the “TEMPLATES” section of other data dictionary listings.

The *second* screen allows you to edit the *contents* of a template. To “jump” to the second screen from the first screen in a Screen Mode, you need only press the \<PF1\>\<Arrow Down\> from wherever you are on the current screen.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/176.png) NOTE: The *first* screen provides the usual kind of field-by-field help in response to entering a single question mark (?); all help messages are displayed in the lower portion of the screen. Also, entering \<PF1\>H provides general ScreenMan help.  
  
The *second* screen, however, does *not* provide help on individual entries. Thus, if you are building a complicated new template from scratch, it is still a good idea to use the traditional, interactive Scrolling Mode with the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] and Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] options.

<u>Figure 203</u> is an example of the first screen of a PRINT template using the Template Edit option:

The dates shown following the “DATE LAST MODIFIED” and “DATE LAST USED” prompts are for informational purposes only and are *not* editable. Also, if a template has been “compiled” into a set of routines, an informational message is displayed near the top of the screen (e.g., “Compiled as ‘^XUFILE0 routine”).

On the *second* screen of the form, you see the SORT, PRINT, or INPUT fields. Thus, you can use this second screen to edit the specific template fields.

<u>Figure 205</u> is an example of the second screen of a PRINT template using the Template Edit option:

<span id="_Ref343503456" class="anchor"></span>Figure 205: File Utilities—Editing a PRINT Template’s Properties in Screen Mode (*Second* Screen)

\<=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======

As you can see from this example, fields under a Multiple field (e.g., ACCESSIBLE FILE) are *indented*. As you edit, add, and delete subfields here, you *mustpreserve the indentation*. The same holds true for <u>Relational Navigation</u> within the template; fields jumped to are in a different file and are indented an extra three spaces each. You do *not* have to indent each new level exactly three spaces; however, there *must* be some extra spaces. Then, if necessary, “un-indent” the same number of spaces to get back to a previous level.

If a SORT template has a user number (i.e., USER \#), only that user can use that SORT template in the VA FileMan Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option. To remove this restriction, simply delete the user number by entering an at-sign (@) at the “USER \#” prompt.

For SORT templates, you can also use the *first* screen of the Template Edit option to associate a particular PRINT template with a SORT template. Thus, whenever that SORT template is invoked in the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option, the associated PRINT template is used by default, with *no* “FIRST PRINT FIELD:” prompt being displayed to the user.

Editing SORT template fields is particularly tricky; however, most SORT templates have only three or so sort levels.

<u>Figure 208</u> is an example of the *second* screen of a SORT template using the Template Edit option:

<span id="_Ref343503475" class="anchor"></span>Figure 208: File Utilities—Editing a SORT Template’s Properties in Screen Mode (*Second* Screen)

The specifications for each successive level of sorting are indented further to the right. You can add or insert sort levels; however, each sort group of lines *must* be indented further to the right than the sort group above it. For each level of sorting, except when the sorting is on a Boolean value, there should be a “From:” line and a “To:” line. You can also have a fourth line that says “ASK” or “DON’T ASK,” for sort ranges other than first-to-last. Remember to indent each line in a sort group by the same number of spaces.

## Uneditable Data

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Uneditable Data option allows you to specify that a field *cannot* be edited or deleted by a user.

If editing is attempted, the field’s value, along with a No Editing message, is displayed. If, however, the value is part of a subfield, the deletion of the entire entry in the Multiple-valued field is allowed, unless the .01 field of the Multiple itself is made uneditable.

You can also use this option to remove the uneditable restriction on a field.

## Mandatory/Required Field Check

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Mandatory/Required Field Check option checks that fields that are key fields or designated as required contain data. It can check one, a series, or all required entries in a file. If an entry lacks data in a required or key field, a report like <u>Figure 209</u> is furnished:

<span id="_Ref389630684" class="anchor"></span>Figure 209: File Utilities—Mandatory/Required Field Check Report

Entry DD-Number/Path Field

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3 FMPATIENT,25 16026 SSN

DIZ(16026,3

If all required and key fields contain data, then the NO REQUIRED FIELD IS MISSING message is displayed.

You can store the results in a template.

## Key Definition

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following topics are covered:

- Create a Key
- Edit a Key
- Delete a Key
- Verify a Key

Using the Key Definition option, VA FileMan allows you to define keys on a file or subfile. A key is a group of fields that, taken collectively, uniquely identifies a record. All fields in a key *must* have values (*must not* be NULL) and those values, taken together, *must* be unique across all records in the file or subfile. VA FileMan enforces KEY INTEGRITY whenever records are added or edited.

Exactly one key in a file *must* be designated the PRIMARY KEY. All other keys are SECONDARY KEYs. While VA FileMan enforces the integrity of both primary and SECONDARY KEYs, the PRIMARY KEY is VA FileMan’s principal means of looking up entries in the file. VA FileMan prompts for lookup values for each of the PRIMARY KEY fields and considers a record a match only if it matches *all* lookup values. The .01 field should be a part of the PRIMARY KEY.

Keys are also useful when transporting data to another system using the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS). Since the key fields uniquely identify a record, it is easy to decide whether a record being brought in to the target system needs to be merged to a record that already exists, or whether it is a new record.

Associated with each key is a *Uniqueness Index*, a regular, New-Style cross-reference. The Uniqueness Index helps VA FileMan enforce KEY INTEGRITY and is used during lookup. When you create a new key, you can have VA FileMan create a new Uniqueness Index automatically for you, or you can select an existing index to be the Uniqueness Index of the key. The index you select, though, *must meet the following criteria*:

- It *must* be a regular, New-Style cross-reference.
- It *must* be used for lookup and sorting; it *cannot* have a name that starts with the letter “A”.
- It *cannot* have any SET or KILL conditions.
- It *must* consist of only field-type cross-reference values, all of which are used as subscripts (i.e., it can contain no computed values).
- No subscripts can have transforms.

### Create a Key

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

COMMAND: Press \<PF1\>H for help Insert

On this screen (<u>Figure 211</u>), in the “KEY FIELDS” section, you can select the fields you wish to include in this key and assign each field a sequence number. The sequence number determines the order in which the fields appear as subscripts in the Uniqueness Index. If you select the key fields in this manner, leave the Uniqueness Index field blank.

When you exit the form, VA FileMan prompts you for a name for the Uniqueness Index, and then creates the index automatically for you, as shown in <u>Figure 212</u>:

<span id="_Ref160546426" class="anchor"></span>Figure 212: File Utilities—Creating the Uniqueness Index Automatically

Press RETURN to continue:

Alternatively, you can leave the information in the KEY FIELDS section blank and select an existing Uniqueness Index. When you exit the form, VA FileMan checks that the information in the KEY FIELDS section is consistent with the selected Uniqueness Index. If there is a conflict, you are asked for a method to resolve the conflict. In this case, select Option \#2, “Make Key match Uniqueness Index,” as shown in <u>Figure 213</u>:

<span id="_Ref160543583" class="anchor"></span>Figure 213: File Utilities—Resolving a Conflict with the Key Fields and Uniqueness Index

When you verify the integrity of a key, VA FileMan checks that all fields in the key have values (are *not*NULL), and that those field values, taken together, are unique across all records in the file. Any problems are reported. You can also save the entries that violate KEY INTEGRITY in a template.

# Auditing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan auditing tracks changes to:

- Data in a field—Auditing a Data Field.
- File’s structure—Auditing a Data Dictionary.

Fields are identified for auditing by using the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option or by using the Turn Data Audit On/Off option (see the “<u>Turning Data Field Audit On/Off</u>” section). Thus, a user with limited VA FileMan access does *not* need the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option to initiate an audit.

Files are identified for auditing by using the Edit File \[DIEDFILE\] option.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/178.png) CAUTION: Auditing can be resource intensive; it can slow your system considerably. It can also use considerable disk space. Use it with discretion.

The Audit Menu \[DIAUDIT\], which is locked with the XUAUDITING security key, is located under the Other Options \[DIOTHER\] menu:

## Auditing a Data Field

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- <u>Overview</u>
- <u>Setting a Data Field Audit</u>
- <u>Turning Data Field Audit On/Off</u>
- <u>Reviewing the Data Field Audit Trail</u>
- <u>Tracking Data Field Audits</u>
- <u>Purging a Data Field Audit Trail</u>

### Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Use the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option to add, change, or delete data values. For example, an admission clerk can use the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option to enter a Date of Birth of “JAN 20, 1949” for patient ONE FMPATIENT. Later, a nurse could use the same option to change the value to “JAN 20, 1950”. You might like to know who made the successive changes and when; the data field audit capability is designed to record this information.

When changes like the ones mentioned in the example above are made to an audited field, the following information is stored in the AUDIT (#1.1) file:

- Date and time the change was made.
- User’s name who made the change.
- Old and new data values.

In other words, starting an audit on a data field provides an ongoing chronological list of who made what changes to data values of fields you are auditing.

### Setting a Data Field Audit

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To begin auditing data changes in a field, use the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option, choose the file and fields that should be audited and answer YES or EDITED to the “AUDIT:” prompt. The possible responses to the “AUDIT:” prompt are:

| Response              | Description                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YES, ALWAYS       | Indicates the audit will occur when data is initially entered, changed or deleted.                                   |
| EDITED OR DELETED | Means that the audit only occurs when changes are made or values deleted (*not* when the data is initially entered). |
| NO                | Turns the audit off.                                                                                                 |
| @                 | Deletes the current audit status (effectively turning audit off), *not* the field.                                   |

<span id="_Ref389632076" class="anchor"></span>Table 95: Data Security—File Access Codes

The example in <u>Figure 218</u> initiates a Data Field audit on the DATE OF BIRTH field of the PATIENT (#2) file. Only changes to pre-existing data are recorded:

<span id="_Ref389631587" class="anchor"></span>Figure 218: Auditing—Example of a Data Field Audit

...

If you have Programmer access, you are also presented with the “AUDIT CONDITION:” prompt. Here, you can restrict the data entries that are audited. Enter a line of M code that *must* evaluate true or false. If it evaluates true, an audit record of the value change is made. Otherwise, no auditing is done for that data entry.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/179.png) REF: For more information on the audit condition, see the “Advanced File Definition” section in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/180.png) NOTE: If auditing is *not* turned on for the field with a YES or EDITED answer to the “AUDIT:” prompt, the field is *not* audited, even if code is entered at the “AUDIT CONDITION:” prompt.

Fields with a DATA TYPE field of COMPUTED *cannot* be audited.

To initiate an audit of data fields or of a data dictionary, you *must* have AUDIT access to the files you want to audit.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/181.png) REF: For more information about AUDIT access, see the “Data Security” section.

### Turning Data Field Audit On/Off

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Users who do *not* have the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option (DD access) to files can be given the Turn Data Audit On/Off \[DIAUDIT TURN ON/OFF\] option. This option is found on VA FileMan’s Audit Menu \[DIAUDIT\]. It is used to begin or end an audit trail for fields. The user *must* have AUDIT access to the file to set data audits. No other access is necessary. The Turn Data Audit On/Off option is called DIAUDIT TURN ON/OFF; it can be granted to users with Kernel’s menu management options. No other attributes in the field definition can be affected by use of this option.

Use of the Turn Data Audit On/Off \[DIAUDIT TURN ON/OFF\] option is very similar to using the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option:

### Reviewing the Data Field Audit Trail

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### CAPTIONED Output with Audit Trail

There are several different ways to retrieve audit information. The simplest is to examine all the audited past values for a particular entry, or a set of entries. Say you are reviewing patient entries in the PATIENT (#2) file. Using either the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] or the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] options, specify the \[CAPTIONED\] output. If the file has audited data on record, you are asked whether you want to see the audit trail on the patients displayed.

Suppose the PATIENT (#2) file has been edited so that patient “FMPATIENT” was first assigned a DOB of 1/20/49, but that subsequently this DOB was changed to 1/20/50.

    Created on Mar 13, 2001@19:41:36 by User \#330

#### Computed-Field Functions for Retrieving Audit Changes

Three powerful new functions allow retrieval of audit data. As with all Computed Expressions, use of these functions is in the context of the entry in the (audited) file.

- PRIORVALUE(Field_name) returns values of the “Field_name” field that existed before a change was made.
- PRIORDATE(Field_name) returns the corresponding date/time at which a change to the field value was made.
- PRIORUSER(Field_name) returns the corresponding user number (“DUZ”) who made the change to the field value.

Each of these Functions is multi-valued, since the Field value for the entry may have been changed more than once in the past. The Functions “1ST”, “2ND”, “LAST”, “COUNT” can be used with these Multiples. Thus, the Computed Expression COUNT(PRIORVALUE(NAME))\>4 means “the NAME on this entry has been changed more than four times in the past”. To find any entry whose NAME <u>used to contain</u> “FMUSER”, search for PRIORVALUE(NAME)\[“FMUSER”\].

A more specialized way to examine audits is to query the AUDIT (#1.1) file to obtain audit information. The set of all past audited events for a given VA FileMan file is itself a VA FileMan file, which can be queried or printed. The entries are identified as follows:

1.  By their internal entry number in the AUDIT (#1.1) file.
18. By the internal entry number of the edited entry from the file being audited.
19. By the date/time of the audited event.

Suppose “FMPATIENT,ONE” is the 355th entry in the PATIENT (#2) file.

<span id="_Toc203327092" class="anchor"></span>Figure 222: Auditing—AUDIT File: Query

Output from what File: PATIENT// <span class="mark">1.1 \<Enter\></span> AUDIT

Another one: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Standard Captioned Output? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (YES)

Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

Responding with YES at the “Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO//” prompt shows the AUDIT (#1.1) file COMPUTED fields:

- ENTRY NAME
- FIELD NAME
- OLD VALUE
- NEW VALUE.

A NO response does *not* show these fields.

<u>Figure 223</u> shows the output that is produced:

<span id="_Ref389631837" class="anchor"></span>Figure 223: Auditing—AUDIT File: Output

NUMBER: 1                  INTERNAL ENTRY NUMBER: 355

DATE/TIME RECORDED: JAN 06, 2003@12:42:08 

FIELD NUMBER: 2    USER: FMUSER,FIVE

OLD INTERNAL VALUE: 2490120 DATATYPE OF OLD VALUE: Da

NEW INTERNAL VALUE: 2500120 DATATYPE OF NEW VALUE: Da

ENTRY NAME (c): FMPATIENT,ONE FIELD NAME (c): DATE

OLD VALUE (c): JAN 06, 2003 NEW VALUE (c): FEB 03, 2003

If you deleted FMPATIENT’s DATE OF BIRTH, the corresponding entry in the AUDIT (#1.1) file would show the NEW VALUE as \<deleted\>. If the entire entry for FMPATIENT were deleted, there would be no value for the ENTRY NAME field in any of the audit listings for that entry. The last audit entry would show \<deleted\> for the NEW VALUE of the DATE OF BIRTH field.

Since the entries in the AUDIT (#1.1) file can be sorted just as flexibly as those in any other VA FileMan file, you could easily, for example, search for all audits that occurred between a range of DATE/TIME RECORDED values.

### Tracking Data Field Audits

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Use the Fields Being Audited \[DIAUDITED FIELDS\] option to list the audited fields from a file or a specified range of files. After selecting the Fields Being Audited \[DIAUDITED FIELDS\] option, give a file (or a range) at the “START WITH What File:” and “GO TO What File:” prompts.

You receive a report with the following data (<u>Figure 224</u>):

- FILE—File number
- NUMBER—Field number
- LABEL—Field name
- TYPE—Type of field being audited
- AUDIT—Type of audit being performed.

The listing in <u>Figure 224</u> shows all fields flagged for auditing in a file range:

### Purging a Data Field Audit Trail

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Use the Purge Data Audits \[DIAUDIT PURGE DATA\] option to purge the audit trail. It purges the records used for auditing data fields for a specified file. Purging audit trails is *not* an automatic feature; it *must* be done manually.

You should do either of the following:

- Turn auditing off on the files you are purging while you are doing the purge.  
    
  Or
- Leave auditing on but purge the file when *not* many users are on the system.

If you purge when auditing is on and people are using the file in question, it is possible that you might end up with incomplete audit records on the audited file.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/182.png) CAUTION: Purged audit records *cannot* be recovered!

## Auditing a Data Dictionary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In addition to auditing changes to data values, changes to data dictionaries are audited.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/184.png) The Description and Technical Description field changes are *not* audited.

- <u>Setting Automatic Data Dictionary Auditing</u>
- <u>Reviewing the Data Dictionary Audit Trail</u>
- <u>Purging a Data Dictionary Audit Trail</u>
- <u>Auditable Word Processing Fields</u>
- <u>Word-Processing Fields Can be Made Uneditable</u>
- <u>Reviewing a User’s Data Access</u>

### Setting Automatic Data Dictionary Auditing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Substantive Data Dictionary changes are automatically recorded. No action is needed to start this auditing. Auditing results are saved in the DD AUDIT (#.6) file. Changes to some documentation-related attributes (e.g., Description and Technical Description) are *not* audited.

### Reviewing the Data Dictionary Audit Trail

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To see what changes were made to a specific file’s data dictionary, use the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] or Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] options and identify the DD AUDIT (#.6) file as the file of choice. To see all changes made to data dictionaries during a period of time use the Show Past Changes to Data Dictionaries \[DIAUDIT SHOW PAST CHG TO DDs\] option.

<u>Figure 229</u> is an example of how to identify the changes made to a data dictionary:

<span id="_Ref389631942" class="anchor"></span>Figure 229: Auditing—Choosing to Review a Data Dictionary Audit

In <u>Figure 230</u> the entries in the DD AUDIT (#.6) file are identified by the field number (2 and 3 in this example), the date of the change (02/20/90 for both entries), and the person making the change (FMUSER,FIVE for both).

<span id="_Ref490665284" class="anchor"></span>Figure 231: Auditing—Reviewing a Data Dictionary Audit

The example in <u>Figure 231</u> indicates that a user named FMUSER,FIVE modified the (fictitious) PATIENT (#999000) file on 2/20 and 2/21/90. This person edited the LABEL (.01 attribute) of Fields \#2 and \#3:

- The LABEL of Field \#2 was changed from DATE OF BIRTH to DOB.
- The LABEL of Field \#3 was changed from CURRENT AGE to AGE.

The number of the first change as it was recorded in the DD AUDIT (#.6) file is 1 and the second is 2.

If, instead, you want a complete listing of all data dictionary changes regardless of file, use the Show Past Changes to Data Dictionaries \[DIAUDIT SHOW PAST CHG TO DDs\] option. This option prompts you for the starting date of the audits you want to see. By default, all changes since the last purge of data dictionary audits will be shown. The audits are sorted by File Number and then in reverse date/time. The field, field attribute, and user making the change are shown as well as the before and after values.

In <u>Figure 232</u>, two files were changed; multiple changes were made to the first and one to the second.

### Purging a Data Dictionary Audit Trail

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Use the Purge DD Audits \[DIAUDIT PURGE DD\] option to erase *all* audit trails used in auditing data dictionaries (including Subfiles that have their own data dictionaries) for a specified file. Purging is *not* an automatic feature; it *must* be done manually.

You should do either of the following:

- Turn auditing off on the files you are purging while you are doing the purge.  
    
  OR
- Leave auditing on but purge the file when *not* many users are on the system.

If you purge when auditing is on and people are using the file in question, it is possible that you might end up with incomplete audit records on the audited file.

You can see when a specified user has accessed a file by using the Monitor A User \[DIAUDIT MONITOR USER\] option . To begin the report, you need to identify the following:

- User you want to monitor.
- File of interest.
- Date.

The resulting report indicates which entries the user edited and the first and last time the user edited them. You can obtain details of the edits made by using the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] or Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] options to query the AUDIT (#1.1) file as described above.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/186.png) NOTE: This option only reports edits for files during periods for which data auditing is turned on.

# Data Security

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan has facilities for screening access to entire files and to data within files on a field-by-field basis. Access to previously defined templates is also controlled.

When used with Kernel, there are two possible mechanisms for control of user access:

- Associating an Access Code with every user and with every file, field, and template on the system. The user’s Access Code is stored in the local variable.
- Doing a lookup into a user’s entry in the NEW PERSON (#200) file to see if the file in question is available to that user. The method is in effect only if Kernel’s File Access Security has been installed on the system. It takes precedence over the Access Code method for file-level security. Field and template security are unaffected by Kernel’s File Access Security; they remain enforced by Access Code.

These methods for data security are described in this section.

## Security at the File Level

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

There are two methods of controlling access to files:

- Access Code Security on Files
- File Access Security (Formerly Part 3 of Kernel)

On a particular system only one method is in effect at a particular time. If File Access Security has been installed, it controls file-level security; otherwise, access is controlled by Access Codes. Obviously, if you are using VA FileMan without Kernel, only Access Code security is possible.

### Access Code Security on Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Access Code is a string of characters that correspond to functional data access categories. For example:

- Uppercase *A* might correspond to entry/editing of Administrative data.
- Lowercase *a* might correspond to viewing of Administrative data.
- Uppercase *F* might correspond to entering or editing Fiscal data.
- Lowercase *f* might correspond to viewing of Fiscal data.

Typically, you go through a password-checking signon process before using VA FileMan. During signon, you are identified by the system and your Access Code is set. For example, it might be equal to *Aaf*, if you are identified as someone entitled to view and change Administrative data, but only to view (search and print) Fiscal data. If you lack any such security clearance, the default value of the Access Code entry is simply NULL.

<u>Table 95</u> lists the Access Codes used to control access to files in six different ways:

<table>
<caption><p><span id="_Toc342980912" class="anchor"></span>Table 96: Data Security—Field Access Codes</p></caption>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<span id="_Toc342980912" class="anchor"></span>Table 96: Data Security—Field Access Codes

All these controls are based on the value of the Access Code. When you access a file, under any of these options, you are *not* allowed to access any file that is protected unless your current Access Code either equals an at-sign (@) or contains at least one character in common with the protection code string of the file. The at-sign (@) is generally reserved for use by developers; it gives Programmer access.

Any new file that you create with a code string in your Access Code is automatically given the following access equal to that code string:

- READ
- WRITE
- DELETE
- LAYGO
- AUDIT

To change these codes later, use the Edit File \[DIEDFILE\] option on the Utility Functions \[DIUTILITY\] menu. Be sure when doing so that your own Access Code contains the codes you want to add or equals the at-sign (@).

### File Access Security (Formerly Part 3 of Kernel)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan also can perform a lookup into a user’s record and see if a specific file has been assigned. If your systems manager has run the special conversion to have access controlled by the ACCESSIBLE FILE Multiple in the NEW PERSON (#200) file, then access to a file is *not* based on an Access Code. Rather, a lookup is done in your record to see if you are allowed access to the file in question. If your VA FileMan Access Code is the at-sign (@), you are allowed access to all files, even if this special conversion has been performed.

Access to files is granted to you by the systems manager who uses Kernel’s File Access Security system.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/187.png) REF: For detailed information about File Access Security, see the [Kernel application documentation on the VA software Document Library (VDL)](https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=10).

## Protection for Fields in a File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Your Access Code is checked to control access to data fields within each file.

| WRITE   |             | The Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option looks at WRITE access for every field used to see if WRITE access has been defined. If the field’s WRITE Access Code has no characters in common with your Access Code, you are *not* able to see that field.                                           |     |
| DELETE  |             | The Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option looks at the DELETE access of a field when you try to delete a value for that field (with the at-sign \[@\]). If there is a DELETE access string and if it has no characters in common with your Access Code, you are prohibited from deleting.     |     |
| READ    |             | The Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\], Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\], and Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] options look at the READ access for every field accessed.

<span id="_Ref451585774" class="anchor"></span>Table 97: Extract Tool—DATA TYPE Field Value Recommendations

There is an exception to this field protection: If the invoking program has set the Access Code equal to the at-sign (@), all fields are accessible. The at-sign (@) is also considered the developer’s Access Code to the *entire* data dictionary.

To enter or edit a field’s READ, DELETE, or WRITE access:

1.  Use the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option.
2.  Indicate the field to be protected.
3.  Enter the desired codes when prompted for the following information:
- “READ ACCESS:”
- “DELETE ACCESS:”
- “WRITE ACCESS:”

Any code character entered *must* be in your current Access Code, unless you have the at-sign (@).

## Protection for Templates

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you create an INPUT, SORT, or PRINT template, your Access Code is assigned to that template for READ access and WRITE access. Anyone else subsequently using the template *must* have a code that has a character in common with the template’s READ access. Anyone who is allowed to change the template *must* have a code with a character in common with the template’s WRITE access. When the template is changed, these Access Codes can also be changed.

Print the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file, the SORT TEMPLATE (#.401) file, and the INPUT TEMPLATE (#.402) file to display the READ access and WRITE access fields for templates.

Every user on the system has a user number. This number is sometimes called DUZ, because it is stored in the local variable DUZ. The user number is the internal entry number in the NEW PERSON (#200) file, if Kernel is installed. VA FileMan uses the user number for security for SEARCH templates. When a SEARCH template is created, it is assigned the DUZ of its creator. Only someone with that DUZ can use the template. You can change the assigned USER \# with the Template Edit \[DITEMP\] option. If the USER \# is deleted, everyone can use the SEARCH template.

# Transferring File Entries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Transfer Entries \[DITRANSFER\] option contains two options:

- Transfer File Entries
- Compare/Merge File Entries

These options allow you to compare and/or merge two entries in a single file or to transfer entries from one file to another. For example, you can combine data from two different entries into one of the two. This could happen in a patient database when the same patient has been inadvertently entered twice with the name spelled slightly differently.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/189.png) CAUTION: Once you have merged file entries, the merging *cannot* be undone. Care *must* be taken that data is *not* mistakenly lost.

## Transfer File Entries Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Transfer File Entries option can be used for several purposes. You can use it to:

- Merge two entries in the same file.
- Transfer one or more records from one file to another file.
- Copy a data dictionary into a new file.

However, the Compare/Merge File Entries option (described in Section <u>14.2</u>, “<u>Compare/Merge File Entries Option</u>”) should usually be used to merge entries in the same file; it is specifically designed for that task.

You *must* have READ access for the file you are transferring from and WRITE access for the file you are transferring to. If you are deleting entries after the transfer, you need DELETE access as well.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/190.png) REF: For the details of file security, see the “<u>Data Security</u>” section.

### Transferring Data within the Same File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use the Transfer File Entries option to merge two entries that are in the same file. To do this:

1.  Identify the input and output file as the same.
20. Identify the two entries.

Data values are then transferred from the FROM entry to the TO entry. <u>Figure 238</u> shows the simple dialog:

<span id="_Ref389631613" class="anchor"></span>Figure 238: Transferring File Entries—Transferring Data within a File

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">TRANSFER ENTRIES</span>

Select TRANSFER OPTION: <span class="mark">?</span>

Input to what File: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

TRANSFER FROM FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

TRANSFER DATA INTO WHICH PATIENT: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,77</span>

TRANSFER FROM PATIENT: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,90</span>

WANT TO DELETE THIS ENTRY AFTER IT'S BEEN TRANSFERRED? NO//

If the TO entry (77 FMPATIENT in <u>Figure 238</u>) already has a value on file for a given field, that value is preserved (i.e., it is *not* overwritten by the corresponding field value in the FROM entry). This rule applies to WORD-PROCESSING data fields also. If the recipient has any text on file, corresponding text from the sender’s entry is *not* merged with it. Thus, if you decide to delete the FROM entry (90 FMPATIENT in <u>Figure 238</u>), you can lose some data.

In the case of distinct Multiple-valued subfields, merging takes place. The subentries in the FROM entry would be added to the Multiple in the TO entry. Further, if two subentries have the same .01 value and if any of the subfields are blank in the TO entry, the FROM subentry’s data is placed in the blank subfield. In this way, data is added to Multiples in the same way that it is added to files.

For example, suppose DIAGNOSIS is the label of the .01 field of a Multiple and AGE AT ONSET is a subfield in that Multiple. If 77 FMPATIENT has a DIAGNOSIS of “Angina” and 90 FMPATIENT has one of “Diabetes”, 77 FMPATIENT ends up with both “Angina” and “Diabetes”. Further, if both 77 FMPATIENT and 90 FMPATIENT had “Angina”, but 77 FMPATIENT had no AGE AT ONSET for that subentry and 90 FMPATIENT did have one, the 90 FMPATIENT’s AGE AT ONSET data for “Angina” would be transferred to 77 FMPATIENT.

<u>Figure 239</u> illustrates the transfer of data values from one entry to another in more detail. (These two entries will also be used in the discussion of the Compare/Merge File Entries option.) Before the transfer, the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option displays these two entries from the (fictitious) SCHOLAR file:

<span id="_Ref389631638" class="anchor"></span>Figure 239: Transferring File Entries—Example Displaying Two Records in a File *Prior* to a Transfer

The transfer is then initiated with the dialog shown in <u>Figure 240</u>:

Data values are then merged such that no pre-existing values are overwritten but new values are added. The DATE OF BIRTH is added since the pre-existing value was NULL. Different subentries in the TOPICS Multiple are added to the pre-existing list of topics. The Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option shows the result:

### Transferring Entries between Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use the Transfer File Entries option to move *all* or a *group* of entries from one file to an entirely separate file. To do this:

1.  Answer the “Input to what File:” prompt and the “TRANSFER FROM FILE:” prompt with different file names.
21. Specify whether transferred entries should be added all as new, or whether they should be merged with existing entries.
22. Specify whether transferred entries should be deleted in the original file.
23. Specify which entries to transfer, by entering sort criteria.

For transfer to occur, the NAME (#.01) fields of both files *must* have matching LABEL fields and DATA TYPE fields. In this way, VA FileMan can identify corresponding entries. Values of the fields can then be transferred. Only those fields where the LABEL and DATA TYPE fields match are transferred. Before the transfer is done, you are told which fields have their data transferred.

The dialog presented when transferring entries to another file is presented in <u>Figure 242</u>. In this instance, you are transferring the contents of the (fictitious) SCHOLAR file to the (fictitious) NEW SCHOLAR file. The (fictitious) NEW SCHOLAR file already exists, and it does have some entries whose NAME field matches those in the (fictitious) SCHOLAR file.

<span id="_Ref160009045" class="anchor"></span>Figure 242: Transferring File Entries—Transferring Entries from one File to Another

Select OPTION: <span class="mark">TRANSFER ENTRIES</span>

Select TRANSFER OPTION: <span class="mark">TRANSFER FILE ENTRIES</span>

TRANSFER ENTRIES BY: NAME// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

START WITH NAME: FIRST// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DEVICE: HOME// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

You can specify whether you want entries with the same NAME (#.01) field to be merged when the transfers are made, or whether each transferred entry and subentry should become a distinct new entry in the target file. (In this case, the answer was YES to merge.) You can also specify whether the entries should be deleted from the “from” file as they are transferred. (In this case (<u>Figure 242</u>), the answer was NO to delete.)

A simple report is created that lists the entries that were transferred. You can route that list to a printer using the “DEVICE:” prompt.

In addition, you have considerable control over which entries are transferred. Your answers to the “TRANSFER ENTRIES BY:” and “START WITH:” prompts select entries in the same way that you specify sort criteria when describing a print output.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/191.png) REF: For more information on sort criteria and print output, see the “Print: How to Print Reports from Files” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

For example, if you only wanted to transfer scholars born after 1900 to the (fictitious) NEW SCHOLAR file, you could answer the “TRANSFER ENTRIES BY:” prompt as sown in <u>Figure 243</u>:

<span id="_Ref160546576" class="anchor"></span>Figure 243: Transferring File Entries—Selecting Specific Entries for Transfer

TRANSFER ENTRIES BY: NAME// <span class="mark">DATE OF BIRTH\>1900</span>

WITHIN DATE OF BIRTH\>1900, TRANSFER ENTRIES BY: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/192.png) NOTE: The Transfer File Entries option can be used to purge files. You can define a (fictitious) SCHOLAR ARCHIVE file containing a subset of the fields that are in the original file (e.g., the fields: NAME, SSN, and DATE OF BIRTH); you can then simply transfer into this separate file all or a selected group of entries from the original file, deleting the entries as they are transferred.

### Transferring Entries into a New File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use the Transfer File Entries option to create a new file. To do this:

1.  At the “Input to what File:” prompt, enter the name of a nonexistent file.
24. If you have Programmer access, you are prompted for the global location for the new file.
25. When you specify the file to transfer *from*, you can request that the data dictionary of that file be copied as the data dictionary for your new file.

<u>Figure 244</u> is an example of using the Transfer File Entries option to create a new file:

<span id="_Ref389630685" class="anchor"></span>Figure 244: Transferring File Entries—Using the Transfer File Entries Option to Create a New File

Input to what File: <span class="mark">SCHOLAR COPY</span>

Are you adding 'SCHOLAR COPY' as a new FILE? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

FILE NUMBER: 16031// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

INTERNAL GLOBAL REFERENCE: ^DIZ(16031,// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

...SORRY, I'M WORKING AS FAST AS I CAN...

A FreeText NAME Field (#.01) has been created.

TRANSFER FROM FILE: <span class="mark">SCHOLAR</span>

DO YOU WANT TO TRANSFER THE 'SCHOLAR' DATA DICTIONARY INTO YOUR NEW

FILE? <span class="mark">YES</span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/193.png) NOTE: You are asked the global reference question only if you have Programmer access.

Answering YES copies (or “clones”) the data definitions of the old file. Then, if the old file has had any templates created, you are asked:

DO YOU WANT TO COPY 'SCHOLAR' TEMPLATES INTO YOUR NEW FILE?

Once you have created a new file with identical field and template descriptions, you can transfer entries into it. This is a method of copying a file.

## Compare/Merge File Entries Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Compare/Merge File Entries option allows you to compare the data value of two entries before merging them into one entry. Furthermore, this option provides you with an opportunity to identify the data values from either entry that are used to create the final merged entry. Both entries involved *must* be in the same file to use this option.

### Comparing Entries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use the Compare/Merge File Entries option as a simple tool to compare entries. To do this:

1.  Identify a file.
2.  Identify the two entries to be compared.
3.  At the “MERGE ENTRIES AFTER COMPARING THEM?” prompt, enter NO.

In <u>Figure 245</u>, two similar entries in the (fictitious) SCHOLAR file are used.

<span id="_Ref389631690" class="anchor"></span>Figure 245: Transferring File Entries—Selecting Entries to Compare in a File (1 of 2)

Select TRANSFER OPTION: <span class="mark">COMPARE/MERGE FILE ENTRIES</span>

Compare Entries in what File: <span class="mark">SCHOLAR</span>

COMPARE SCHOLAR: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT</span>

VA FileMan responds to this abbreviated response with the matching entries in the list shown in <u>Figure 246</u>:

<span id="_Ref160543951" class="anchor"></span>Figure 246: Transferring File Entries—Selecting Entries to Compare in a File (2 of 2)

> **NOTE:** Use this option ONLY DURING NON-PEAK HOURS if merging entries in a

file that is pointed-to either by many files, or by large files.

MERGE ENTRIES AFTER COMPARING THEM? No// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Here you choose whether to simply compare entries or to merge them. If you are merging, the process of repointing entries in other files from the merged-from entry to the merged-to entry can be time-consuming or can create many tasked jobs. This is more likely if the file is pointed to by many files or if the files that point to it have many entries. In these situations, consider merging at times when your system is *not* busy.

Press RETURN to continue or '^' to exit:

The asterisks (“\*\*\*”) appearing in front of the field label indicate the entries contain different data in those fields. This simple report compares the data in each field in the two entries.

### Merging Entries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use the Compare/Merge File Entries option to merge entries. To do this:

1.  Identify a file.
26. Identify the two entries to be compared.
27. At the “MERGE THESE ENTRIES AFTER COMPARING THEM?” prompt, enter YES.
28. Choose which entry supplies the default values.
29. Choose to retain or delete the “merge from” record.
30. Optionally adjust, field-by-field, which entry supplies the default value.
31. Choose to proceed with the merge, summarize before merging, or re-edit the merge criteria.

The Merge process is described in detail via the example in <u>Figure 248</u>:

<span id="_Ref504552576" class="anchor"></span>Figure 248: Transferring File Entries—Merging Entries in a File

MERGE THESE ENTRIES AFTER COMPARING THEM? NO// <span class="mark">YES</span>

1 FMPATIENT,23 A.

2 FMPATIENT,23 H.

After choosing a file and two entries to compare, enter YES at the “MERGE THESE ENTRIES AFTER COMPARING THEM? NO//” prompt to merge the entries as well as compare them.

You now specify which of the two entries are used to supply the default values. The entry you choose is the “merge to” entry that contains the merged data, as shown in <u>Figure 249</u>:

<span id="_Ref504552652" class="anchor"></span>Figure 249: Transferring File Entries—Choosing which File Entry will Serve as the Default Entry

> **NOTE:** Records will be merged into the entry selected for the default.

WHICH ENTRY SHOULD BE USED FOR DEFAULT VALUES (1 OR 2)? <span class="mark">1</span>

\*\*\* Records will be merged into FMPATIENT,23 A.

You next indicate the disposition of the “merge from” entry. You can choose to delete it or retain it unmodified. You can also redirect pointers that point to the “merged from” entry to point to the “merge to” entry. Free text pointers are *not* redirected.

<span id="_Ref452362996" class="anchor"></span>Figure 250: Transferring File Entries—Deleting the “Merged From” File Entry

DO YOU WANT TO DELETE THE MERGED FROM ENTRY AFTER MERGING ? <span class="mark">YES</span>

DO YOU WANT TO REPOINT ENTRIES POINTING TO THIS ENTRY? <span class="mark">YES</span>

ENTER FILE TO EXCLUDE FROM REPOINT/MERGE: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/194.png) NOTE: You can also choose to exclude pointers from specified files in the repointing process. In this example (<u>Figure 250</u>), all pointers are repointed.

<span id="_Toc342980926" class="anchor"></span>Figure 251: Transferring File Entries—Setting Up the Merge Output

DO YOU WANT TO DISPLAY ONLY THE DISCREPANT FIELDS? NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DEVICE: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Press the Enter key at the “DEVICE:” prompt so that you can continue to control how the merge is to proceed. Since the merge is interactive, it is *not* appropriate to release control to a printer or other output device. While working at a keyboard printer is possible, it is *not recommended*, because you are *not* able to monitor the selection of data values that is described below.

VA FileMan displays the data from the entries being merged. Brackets (\[ \]) indicate the values that are used to create the final merged entry. If the data values in both entries are the same, no brackets are shown. To start, the values for “FMPATIENT,23 A.” are bracketed because that entry was chosen as the default entry. To switch the value that goes into the merged entry, enter that field’s number.

<u>Figure 252</u> shows the initial defaults in brackets and the response to switching the value for the SSN field:

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/195.png) NOTE: The DATE OF BIRTH field (<u>Figure 252</u>) from FMPATIENT,23 H. is bracketed because the default entry has no value for that field; it is NULL. When the default (“merged to”) entry has no data in a field, data is always brought over from the “merged from” entry. You have no control over this aspect of the merging. Even if you attempt to switch the data value to the NULL value and remove the brackets, the data is still brought into the “merged to” field.

If there is more than one screen of field information, VA FileMan displays additional screens. In this case, there is one field that is a Multiple. The Compare/Merge File Entries option neither displays data from WORD-PROCESSING or Multiple fields nor allows the selection of data for the final “merge to” entry. The number of subentries in the Multiples of the two fields is displayed:

The merging of data for a WORD-PROCESSING field or for a Multiple and its subfields is done in the same way that the Transfer File Entries option does it.

Although VA FileMan is ready to perform the merge now, you are prompted with other options—just in case you are *not* ready. To cancel the merge, enter the caret (^) at the “ACTION:” prompt to exit.

<span id="_Ref160010211" class="anchor"></span>Figure 254: Transferring File Entries—Merge Options

# Extract Tool

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Using the Extract Tool, you can move or copy data from logical records in VA FileMan files to a new VA FileMan file. This new file may either *permit* users to modify its contents or *prevent* users from modifying its contents and can be available for online inquiries and print processes. If this new file is used to store archived data, any options and utilities that create new entries or update existing entries are restricted. Options and utilities that update the data dictionary are also restricted.

## Extract Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following is an overview of the process of using the Extract Tool to extract entries from a file:

1.  Identify the files and fields from which to extract data by using information in the data dictionary listings.
32. Build a destination file by creating a new field for each field in the source file.
33. Select the source file entries from which data is extracted by creating a SEARCH/SORT template.
34. Select the fields from which data is extracted by creating an EXTRACT template.
35. Move the extracted data to the destination file by using the Update Destination File \[DIAX UPDATE\] option.
36. Purge the selected entries from the active database.

## Important Items to Note

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Before beginning the extract process, consider each of the following important facts about the Extract Tool:

- An extract activity is file-specific, *not* user-specific. Anyone with access to the file and the Extract Tool options can complete or change an existing extract activity.
- When the extracted data is moved to the destination file, the source entries in the primary file are blocked from selection.
- A Subfile *cannot* be extracted by itself. At least one field from every Multiple level *above* the Subfile *must* also be extracted. If no field is extracted at the next higher level, the .01 field at that level will automatically be extracted.
- You can extract identifiers and/or key fields from the source file to the destination file, so that records in the destination file can be uniquely identified.
- An EXTRACT template is the only type of PRINT template that can be used by the Update Destination File \[DIAX UPDATE\] option.
- The ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file contains a brief history that describes who performed the various extract activity steps and when the steps were completed.
- The extract activity can be canceled at any time before the Purge Extracted Entries \[DIAX PURGE\] option is used.
- The Purge Extracted Entries \[DIAX PURGE\] option deletes all source data in the primary file from which you extracted data.
- Selected entries *cannot* be purged until they have been moved to the destination file.
- A second extract from a file *cannot* be performed until the active extract activity has been completed, either by purging or canceling.

### Source File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The term source file represents the primary file and any other files that can be referenced by extended pointers. The primary file is the starting file from which you extract your data. The term extract field refers to any field in the source file.

### Destination File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The term “destination file” represents the VA FileMan file that stores the extracted data. The destination file can be located anywhere on the network that is recognized by the system. To create this file, you can select either of the following two VA FileMan options:

- Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\], which is located on the VA FileMan \[DIUSER\] menu.
- Modify Destination File \[DIAX MODIFY\], which is located on the Extract Data To Fileman File \[DIAX EXTRACT MENU\] menu.

For each extract field in the source file, a corresponding field in the destination file *must* exist. Certain DATA TYPE field values can optionally be resolved to external form before moving the data to the destination file. For example, data extracted from a DATA TYPE field of POINTER TO A FILE can be moved to a FREE TEXT-type field in the destination file, if external form of data is moved; or such data can be moved to a NUMERIC-type field, if the internal value is moved.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/197.png) REF: For more information, see the “<u>Mapping Information</u>” section.

The destination file uses a file level attribute called ARCHIVE FILE. The following is a description of this flag:

- YES—This is an archive file, and users *cannot* modify or delete the data or the data dictionary. Any data dictionary changes may invalidate the archived data.
- NO (or NULL)—There are no restrictions on the file.

If you need to update an archive file’s data dictionary, you *must* convert the old data to the new data dictionary format.

Updates to an archive file are allowed only through either of the following:

- Update Destination File \[DIAX UPDATE\] extract option
- EXTRACT^DIAXU API.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/198.png) REF: For more information on the Extract Tool API (EXTRACT^DIAXU), see the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

Only Regular, KWIC, and Soundex-type cross-references are *recommended* for archive files. No other types of cross-references should be created.

If you are building a destination file that will store archived data, set the ARCHIVE FILE flag to YES (do this with the Modify Destination File \[DIAX MODIFY\] option). Setting the ARCHIVE FILE flag to YES prevents users from modifying or deleting the data in the file or the file’s data dictionary while using VA FileMan options or API calls. Users are also prevented from deleting file entries while using VA FileMan options or API calls.

## Mapping Information

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Mapping information identifies the relationship between the data in the source file and the data in the destination file. When you create your EXTRACT template, you will enter the name of the field in the source file and identify its intended location in the destination file. You will need to ensure that the DATA TYPE field value of the field in the destination file is compatible with the DATA TYPE field value of the extract field. The compatibility of the DATA TYPE field values is validated when the fields are specified during template creation.

<u>Table 97</u> recommends the DATA TYPE field values to use, depending on the DATA TYPE field value of the extract field:

<span id="_Ref504555636" class="anchor"></span>Table 98: META DATA DICTIONARY (#.9) File Fields

The following are additional guidelines that you *must* follow while creating your destination file:

- If you are extracting a SET OF CODES-type field and you are mapping it to a FREE TEXT-type field, use a maximum length of the same—or greater than—length as the longest external value in the SET OF CODES field. If you are mapping the SET OF CODES-type field to a SET OF CODES-type field, create the corresponding field in the destination file, using the same specifications as the extract field.
- If you are extracting DATA TYPE field values of any of the following:
- FREE TEXT
- DATE/TIME
- NUMERIC
- WORD-PROCESSING
- MUMPS

Create the corresponding field in the destination file, using the same specifications as the extract field.

- If you are extracting a Multiple-type field, create the corresponding field in the destination file as a Multiple-type field. Multiples in the source file are moved to Multiples in the destination file, following the DATA TYPE field value recommendations listed in <u>Table 97</u>. The structure of the Multiple in the destination file should be the same as that in the source file down to the lowest level Multiple that you extract. When extracting data in a Subfile, at least one field from every Multiple level above the Subfile *must* also be extracted. If you do *not* specify a field to extract at a higher level, the .01 field at that level is automatically extracted.
- If you are extracting a Backward Extended Pointer-type field, create the corresponding field in the destination file as a Multiple. The Extract Tool resolves Backward Pointers. Thus, their values are moved to Multiples in the destination file.
- If the field you are extracting has an OUTPUT transform, make sure the INPUT transform of the destination field can receive the data in the format generated by the OUTPUT transform.

## ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To learn about the status of an extract activity you can enter a question mark at most of the prompts in the Extract Data To Fileman File \[DIAX EXTRACT MENU\] menu options (aka Extract Tool menu option). Using the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option on the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file yields information about past or pending activities. Those activities created by the Extract Tool are referred to as extract activities. The amount of information displayed depends on the status of the extract activity. The ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file contains the following information:

- DUZ of the individual performing the extract activity.
- Status of the extract activity (e.g., EDITED or UPDATED).
- Dates on which the activities were performed.
- Number of entries extracted.
- Source file number.
- SEARCH/SORT and PRINT templates used in the extract activity.

Beginning with VA FileMan 20.0 and later, the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file contains data about both archiving and extract activities. A file can have only *one* active activity at a time, either of the following:

- Archiving activity
- Extract activity

You can only select an extract activity from the Extract Data To Fileman File \[DIAX EXTRACT MENU\] menu (aka Extract Tool menu). When you use the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option, the word EXTRACT appears for all extract activities.

## Extract Steps

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The order of the options on the Extract Data To Fileman File \[DIAX EXTRACT MENU\] menu (aka Extract Tool menu), reflects the sequence of steps in which you ordinarily perform your extract activity.

To access the Extract Data To Fileman File \[DIAX EXTRACT MENU\] menu (aka Extract Tool menu options, start at the Other Options \[DIOTHER\] menu.

<u>Figure 257</u> is a sample of the dialog that you encounter.

### Select Entries to Extract Option (1 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Select Entries to Extract \[DIAX SELECT\] option initiates the extract activity. In this option, the entries are selected and stored in a template and an entry in the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file is created. Entries are selected in the same manner as the Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] option.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/199.png) REF: For guidance on selecting entries, see the “Search” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

The Select Entries to Extract \[DIAX SELECT\] option performs the following functions:

1.  During the search phase, the search criteria for selecting entries are specified and *must* be stored in a template.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/200.png) NOTE: If you want to extract a subentry contained in a Multiple field, you *must* extract the entire entry.

2.  During the sort phase, which is indicated by the “SORT BY” prompt, you can enter additional restrictions on the entries to be selected. If no further restrictions are required, simply accept the defaults provided at the “SORT BY” and “START WITH” prompts.
3.  During the print phase, which is indicated by the “PRINT FIELD” prompt, VA FileMan gathers the entries specified in the search and sort phases and adds the internal entry numbers of the selected entries to the SEARCH template. Although specifying print fields is *not* required, the print process *must* be run to completion. Simply press the Enter key at the “PRINT FIELD” prompt or specify actual fields to print a report of identifying information for the extracted records.

In the sample dialog in <u>Figure 258</u>, notice the sequence in which the search, sort, and print prompts appear:

<span id="_Ref84342924" class="anchor"></span>Figure 258: Extract Tool—Search, Sort, and Print Options When Selecting Entries to Extract

After you use this option, VA FileMan marks the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file entry with a status of SELECTED. If an unfinished extract activity exists for a file and you select this same file for a subsequent extract activity, you see the message shown in <u>Figure 260</u>:

<span id="_Ref389635027" class="anchor"></span>Figure 260: Extract Tool—Example of a Notice Regarding an Outstanding Extract Activity

There is already an outstanding *extract* activity.

Please finish it or CANCEL it.

Since the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file maintains a record of both your extract and archiving activities, you see the italicized word *archiving* whenever the outstanding file activity is an archiving one. To add or delete entries from the SEARCH/SORT template you just created, use the Add/Delete Selected Entries \[DIAX ADD/DELETE\] option.

### Add/Delete Selected Entries Option (2 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you wish to add entries to the extract activity or you wish to delete an entry or entries, use the Add/Delete Selected Entries \[DIAX ADD/DELETE\] option. This option provides an easy way to eliminate undesired entries or to add the ones needed to your list of entries to extract. Like the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option, this option displays a selected entry and then asks if you want to delete or add the entry. If you modify the list, then the activity’s status in the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file changes from SELECTED to EDITED.

You can only use this option to modify your list before the entries are moved to the destination file. If you need to change the extract activity list after the destination file is updated, you need to cancel the extract activity and start a new extract activity.

To use the Add/Delete Selected Entries \[DIAX ADD/DELETE\] option, select the extract activity you want to modify by entering the archival activity number, source file number, or source file name. Then select the entry to be added or deleted.

<u>Figure 261</u> depicts the sequence you follow when adding an entry to the extract activity:

- The “DELETE this entry...?” prompt appears whenever you select an entry that is currently on the extract list.
- The “ADD this entry...?” prompt appears whenever you select an entry that is *not* among the items on the list.

### Print Selected Entries Option (3 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To display the list of entries you have selected, use the Print Selected Entries \[DIAX PRINT\] option. This option uses the standard VA FileMan interface for printing.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/202.png) REF: For guidance on printing entries, see the “Print: How to Print Reports from Files” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

### Modify Destination File Option (4 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use either the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option or the Modify Destination File \[DIAX MODIFY\] options when you are ready to create the destination file that receives your extracted data. You can also use these options to correct discrepancies that you noticed while you were building your EXTRACT template. The two options are nearly identical. However, one major difference exists: the Modify Destination File \[DIAX MODIFY\] option prompts for a new file attribute: ARCHIVE FILE (see the “<u>Destination File</u>” section). If you use the Modify File Attributes \[DIMODIFY\] option to create the destination file, you need to access the Modify Destination File \[DIAX MODIFY\] option to set the ARCHIVE FILE flag.

<u>Figure 264</u> is a sample of the type of dialog that you encounter when modifying your destination file:

<span id="_Ref389630688" class="anchor"></span>Figure 264: Extract Tool—Using the MODIFY DESTINATION FILE Option (1 of 2)

Select EXTRACT OPTION: <span class="mark">MODIFY \<Enter\></span> DESTINATION FILE

This option allows you to build a file which will store data

extracted from other files. When creating fields in the

destination file, all data types are selectable. However, only a

few data types are acceptable for receiving extracted data.

Please see your User Manual for more guidance on building the

destination file.

MODIFY WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">CHANGE EXTRACT</span>

From this point on, you see the usual dialog while creating a new file and creating fields.

Once you have finished creating your destination file, you see the dialog in <u>Figure 265</u>:

Select EXTRACT OPTION:

### Create Extract Template Option (5 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When selecting destination fields for data to be extracted into, keep in mind that the INPUT transforms of the destination fields are executed for each field value. For an extracted record, the value of each field in the record is tested against the INPUT transform of its destination field. If any field fails the INPUT transform, the extract for the entire record fails. Make sure the INPUT transforms on the destination fields are appropriate for the data being extracted.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/203.png) NOTE: If you are extracting a subrecord using the EXTRACT^DIAXU entry point and its FILING_LEVEL parameter, and a value fails the INPUT transform, only the extract of the Subrecord fails.

When you are ready to build an EXTRACT template, you *must* select the Create Extract Template \[DIAX CREATE\] option. Using this option, you identify not only the field you wish to extract from the source file but also its corresponding field in the destination file. The EXTRACT template is the only type of PRINT template used in the Update Destination File \[DIAX UPDATE\] option.

Building an EXTRACT template requires entering valid field numbers or field names at the “EXTRACT FIELD” prompt. Since VA FileMan stores EXTRACT templates in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file, this option uses the term “PRINT TEMPLATE” instead of “EXTRACT TEMPLATE” in the dialog. For each extract field that you identify in the source file, at the “MAP TO” field prompt, enter the destination file field name or field number that receives the data. Only those fields defined in the EXTRACT template appear in the destination file.

Keep in mind that the value of each field in an extracted record is tested against the INPUT transform of its destination field. If any value fails its destination field’s INPUT transform, the extract for the entire record fails. Make sure the INPUT transforms on the destination fields are appropriate for the data you are extracting.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/204.png) NOTE: If you are extracting a subrecord using the EXTRACT^DIAXU entry point and its FILING_LEVEL parameter, and a value fails the INPUT transform, only the extract of the Subrecord fails.

When you arrive at the “STORE EXTRACT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE:” prompt, enter the name that you wish to assign to your new EXTRACT template. To edit an existing EXTRACT template, on the other hand, simply enter its name at the “FIRST EXTRACT FIELD:” prompt—using the following format:

"\[Extract templatename"

<u>Figure 266</u> is a sample of the dialog that you encounter when you are ready to build an EXTRACT template:

<span id="_Ref504553318" class="anchor"></span>Figure 266: Extract Tool—Using the CREATE EXTRACT TEMPLATE Option

Select EXTRACT OPTION: <span class="mark">CREATE \<Enter\></span> EXTRACT TEMPLATE

This option lets you build a template where you specify fields to extract and

their corresponding mapping in the destination file.

For more detailed description of requirements on the destination file, please

see your VA FileMan User Manual.

Are you adding 'CHANGE EXTRACT' as a new PRINT TEMPLATE? No// <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

While you are creating your EXTRACT template, VA FileMan performs a few validation checks. Inspecting the extract field and its corresponding field in the destination file, VA FileMan checks to see if both fields are compatible in several important areas, including:

- Data type
- Minimum length
- Maximum length
- Minimum values
- Maximum values

If a discrepancy exists, VA FileMan displays an error message such as the statement shown in <u>Figure 267</u>:

<span id="_Ref389632204" class="anchor"></span>Figure 267: Extract Tool—Example of a Notice Regarding a Discrepancy

PROGRAMMER field in CHANGE EXTRACT file should have a maximum

length of at least 30 characters.

After VA FileMan displays an error message about your destination field, you can continue building your template. You are *not*, however, able to update the destination file until you have corrected the problem.

<u>Figure 268</u> shows the warning that you see when any source field and its corresponding destination field fail one of the validation checks:

<span id="_Ref389630689" class="anchor"></span>Figure 268: Extract Tool—Example of the Warning Message When the Validation Check Fails

THE DESTINATION FILE DATA DICTIONARY SHOULD BE MODIFIED PRIOR TO

ANY MOVEMENT OF EXTRACT DATA!

At any “MAP ‘FIELD NAME’ TO ‘FILE NAME’ FIELD:” prompt, entering two question marks (“ ??”) yields a list of the selectable fields in the destination file. The list gets shorter as fields are selected to ensure that no two extract fields map information to a single field in the destination file.

### Update Destination File Option (6 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Once you have used the Update Destination File \[DIAX UPDATE\] option, the extracted data from the source file is moved to the destination file. After you enter the name of the EXTRACT template that you wish to use, VA FileMan makes sure the template’s mapping information is correct and acceptable and then populates the destination file, adding entries as new records. VA FileMan does *not*, however, check to see if any of those records to be moved already exist in the destination file. Since this two-step process can be quite time-consuming, it can be queued at the “DEVICE:” prompt.

Excuse me, this will take a few moments...

Checking the destination file...

If entries cannot be moved to the destination file, an exception

report will be printed.

Select a device where to print the exception report.

QUEUEING to this device will queue the Update process.

EXCEPTION REPORT DEVICE: <span class="mark">Q \<Enter\></span> UEUE TO PRINT ON

DEVICE: <span class="mark">PRINTER</span>

After the destination file has been updated, VA FileMan changes the extract activity status from SELECTED or EDITED to UPDATED DESTINATION FILE. At this point, the entries from the source file are no longer available on lookups. This protective measure prevents you from attempting to edit the selected source file entries, so that they contain the same data as the corresponding destination file entries.

The Exception Report in <u>Figure 270</u> is printed when the Extract Tool fails to move all data in a source entry into the destination file. A failed INPUT transform is one possible cause of such a failure. In this case, the incomplete entry in the destination file is deleted. The source entry is *not* locked, and its internal entry number is deleted from the extract list. The total number of entries extracted is reduced by the total numbers of entries appearing on the exception report.

<span id="_Ref389632252" class="anchor"></span>Figure 270: Extract Tool—Exception Report

EXTRACT ACTIVITY EXCEPTION REPORT JUN 27,1996 PAGE: 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTRACT ACTIVITY: 9 ARCHIVER: FMEMPLOYEE,J

THE FOLLOWING ENTRIES IN THE 'TEST' FILE WERE NOT MOVED BY THE

EXTRACT TOOL

Entry \# 9 was NOT processed because:

The value 'NEW' for field FTEXT MULT LABEL in FTEXT MULT SUB-FIELD in file TEST is not

valid.

Enter \# 30 was NOT processed because:

The value 'NEW' for field FTEXT MULT LABEL in FTEXT MULT SUB-FIELD in file TEST is not

valid.

\*\*\* PLEASE KEEP THIS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE \*\*\*

The following is a list of recommended steps to take when an exception report is printed:

1.  Finish the active extract activity by purging or canceling.
37. Determine the problem with the source entry and fix it.
38. If there are several entries on the exception report, start another extract activity. Your SEARCH/SORT template can be reused to use the same search specifications.
39. Adjust the extract list to match the list of entries on the exception report by using the Add/Delete Selected Entries \[DIAX ADD/DELETE\] option.
40. Proceed as before.

For exceptions caused by INPUT transforms, keep in mind that the value of each field in an extracted record is tested against the INPUT transform of its destination field. If any value fails its destination field’s INPUT transform, the extract for the entire record fails. Make sure the INPUT transforms on the destination fields are appropriate for the data you are extracting.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/205.png) NOTE: If you are extracting a subrecord using the EXTRACT^DIAXU entry point and its FILING_LEVEL parameter, and a value fails the INPUT transform, only the extract of the Subrecord fails.

### Purge Extracted Entries Option (7 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you have DELETE access to the primary file, you can use the Purge Extracted Entries \[DIAX PURGE\] option to delete extracted data from the primary file (e.g., CHANGE file). After you have purged your entries, VA FileMan updates the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file.

If you attempt to purge an extract activity that lacks the status UPDATED DESTINATION FILE, you encounter the message shown in <u>Figure 271</u>:

<span id="_Ref123804116" class="anchor"></span>Figure 271: Extract Tool—Example of a Notice from VA FileMan When Extract Activity Lacks the Status UPDATED DESTINATION FILE

Data has NOT YET been moved to the destination file!

When purging extracted data, you encounter a dialog much like the one in <u>Figure 272</u>:

<span id="_Ref504553429" class="anchor"></span>Figure 272: Extract Tool—Using the PURGE EXTRACTED ENTRIES Option (1 of 2)

Select EXTRACT OPTION: <span class="mark">PURGE \<Enter\></span> EXTRACTED ENTRIES

Select EXTRACT ACTIVITY: <span class="mark">3 \<Enter\></span> CHANGE 08-30-92 UPDATED

DESTINATION FILE SELECTOR:FMEMPLOYEE,J EXTRACT

If the source file has fields from other files pointing to it, the Extract Tool displays the text shown in <u>Figure 273</u>:

<span id="_Ref451589780" class="anchor"></span>Figure 273: Extract Tool—Using the PURGE EXTRACTED ENTRIES Option (2 of 2)

The records about to be purged should not be 'pointed to' by other

records to maintain database integrity.

This option will DELETE DATA from both CHANGE

and from the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY file.

Are you sure you want to continue? NO// <span class="mark">YES</span>

The entries will be deleted in INTERNAL NUMBER order.

\<\< 4 ENTRIES PURGED \>\>

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/206.png) CAUTION: As you can see (<u>Figure 273</u>), entering a YES response to the “Are you sure you want to continue? NO//” prompt deletes the entries immediately!

### Cancel Extract Selection Option (8 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can cancel an extract activity any time before the entries are purged by using the Cancel Extract \[DIAX CANCEL\] option. If the extract activity status is UPDATED DESTINATION FILE, which means the entries have already been moved to the destination file, you see a warning notice. At this point, you can roll back or delete the new entries that were created while using the Update Destination File \[DIAX UPDATE\] option.

After you have canceled an extract activity, VA FileMan deletes the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file reference to the extract activity. In addition, you once again can gain access to all of those source entries that VA FileMan locked during the update of your destination file. To extract data *without* purging the source entries, cancel the extract activity to unlock the selected entries in the source file.

You encounter the dialog in <u>Figure 274</u> while canceling an extract activity:

<span id="_Ref389632299" class="anchor"></span>Figure 274: Extract Tool—Using the CANCEL EXTRACT SELECTION Option

Select EXTRACT OPTION: <span class="mark">CANCEL EXTRACT SELECTION</span>

Select EXTRACT ACTIVITY: <span class="mark">CHANGE \<Enter\></span> 3 CHANGE 08-31-92

UPDATED DESTINATION FILE SELECTOR:FMEMPLOYEE,O EXTRACT

Are you sure you want to CANCEL this EXTRACT ACTIVITY? NO// <span class="mark">??</span>

Enter YES to stop this activity and start again from the beginning.

Are you sure you want to CANCEL this EXTRACT ACTIVITY? NO// <span class="mark">YES</span>

This extract activity has already updated the destination file.

Delete the destination file entries created by this extract activity? NO// <span class="mark">??</span>

Enter YES to rollback the destination file to its state before

the update.

Delete the destination file entries created by this extract

activity? NO// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

\>\>\> DONE \<\<\<

To cancel an extract selection so that you can start over, enter YES at the “Delete the destination file entries...” prompt. Entering YES prevents you from sending a duplicate set of entries to the destination file. If, on the other hand, you simply want to cancel the extract selection, pressing the Enter key at the prompt unlocks the source entries and retains the destination file entry.

### Validate Extract Template Option (9 of 9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

After you have corrected any discrepancies that VA FileMan might have pointed out while you were creating an EXTRACT template, you can use the Validate Extract Template \[DIAX VALIDATE\] option to quickly check your EXTRACT template’s mapping information. The Validate Extract Template \[DIAX VALIDATE\] option does *not* alter anything in your template. <u>Figure 275</u> is a sample dialog:

<span id="_Ref389629479" class="anchor"></span>Figure 275: Extract Tool—Using the VALIDATE EXTRACT TEMPLATE Option

Select EXTRACT OPTION: <span class="mark">VAL \<Enter\></span> IDATE EXTRACT TEMPLATE

# Filegrams

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/207.png) NOTE: To use the full capabilities of VA FileMan’s Filegram procedures, Kernel 6.5 or later *must* be installed on your system.

Filegrams are a feature in VA FileMan intended for use by system managers and software developers.

A Filegram is a process that moves a record (also called an entry) from a file on one computer system to a duplicate file on another, independent computer system. An independent computer system is defined as a system having its own database.

You can move a Filegram by either of the following methods:

- Locally—Sending data from the “live” account at a medical center to a “test” account at the same medical center is an example of moving a Filegram locally.
- Remotely—Sending data from a computer in the San Francisco Medical Center to a computer in the Salt Lake City Medical Center is an example of moving a Filegram remotely.

The records you can move by a Filegram can be either of the following types:

- Physical—Records stored in one file.
- Logical—Related fields stored in different files. Logical records are loaded into Filegrams by using VA FileMan’s relational navigational syntax (:).

For successful Filegram installation, the recipient system *must* have the following:

- Kernel 6.5 or later.
- The FILEGRAM HISTORY (#1.12) file.
- The Filegram key to the Filegram submenu.
- A file structure that matches the one reflected by the entry in the Filegram. This is the structure existing on the sender’s system.

## FILEGRAM-Type Templates

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Filegram process requires you to create an OUTPUT template, which is stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file along with regular PRINT templates. VA FileMan recognizes the FILEGRAM-type and regular PRINT templates as OUTPUT templates, but their similarity ends there.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/208.png) NOTE: Since FILEGRAM-type templates are stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file, the dialogs you encounter in the Filegram process refer to a FILEGRAM-type template as a PRINT template.

Regular PRINT templates already created are screened so that you *cannot* accidentally replace an existing PRINT template with a FILEGRAM-type template.

## Filegram and Archiving Relationship

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

FILEGRAM-type templates are the only kind of template allowed in the archiving process.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/209.png) REF: For a full description of archiving in VA FileMan, see the “<u>Archiving</u>” section.

## Filegram Menu Options

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Filegrams \[DIFG\] menu, which is located under the Other Options \[DIOTHER\] menu, is shown in <u>Figure 276</u>:

## Using Filegrams

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following is a summary of the basic steps needed to send and install a Filegram:

1.  The Filegram sender creates a [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) for a specified file using the Create/Edit Filegram Template \[DIFG CREATE\] option.  
      
    Use the Display Filegram Template \[DIFG DISPLAY\] option to review the template.
41. The sender can optionally designate specifiers with the Specifiers \[DIFG SPECIFIERS\] option. These are used for matching existing entries with Filegrams.
42. The sender then generates a Filegram for a specific entry using the Generate Filegram \[DIFG GENERATE\] option. The Filegram is placed into a MailMan message. The Filegram sender sends this message to an individual or individuals at a remote or local destination.
43. The recipient receives the Filegram with MailMan, reading the mail message containing the Filegram, and forwarding it to S.DIFG-SRV-HISTORY. This is a special server that loads the message into the recipient’s FILEGRAM HISTORY (#1.12) file and sets up the interface between VA FileMan and MailMan on the target system.
44. If you want to install the Filegram on a system other than the one where you received it, instead of immediately forwarding it to the S.DIFG-SRV-HISTORY server, forward the message to an individual on the ultimate target system (who in turn forwards it to *their*S.DIFG-SRV-HISTORY server.
45. Both the sender and the recipient can use the View Filegram \[DIFG VIEW\] option to inspect the Filegram.
46. Then, the recipient of the Filegram on the target system uses the Install/Verify Filegram \[DIFG INSTALL\] option to install the Filegram into the destination file.
47. Senders and recipients can delete a Filegram at any time.

The recipient can choose to modify the S.DIFG-SRV-HISTORY server or create another server to aid in the installation of Filegrams.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/210.png) REF: For additional information about setting up servers, see the following documentation on the VA Software Document Library (VDL):

- [Kernel application documentation on the VA software Document Library (VDL)](https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=10)
- [MailMan application documentation on the VA software Document Library (VDL)](https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=15)

## Filegram Steps

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Create/Edit Filegram Template Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Use the Create/Edit Filegram Template \[DIFG CREATE\] option to create a [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) or edit an existing FILEGRAM-type template. A [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) is like a regular PRINT template without any formatting instructions. You always receive the “STORE FILEGRAM LOGIC IN TEMPLATE:” prompt, no matter how many fields you identify.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/211.png) REF: For information about regular PRINT templates, see the “Print: How to Print Reports from Files” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

The Create/Edit Filegram Template \[DIFG CREATE\] option is the first step in developing a Filegram; there is no Filegram without the template. This template is also used in the archiving process. Before using this option, you may wish to familiarize yourself with the files and fields involved.

<u>Figure 277</u> illustrates how to create a [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates):

<span id="_Ref389632332" class="anchor"></span>Figure 277: Filegrams—Creating a FILEGRAM Template (1 of 3)

You can enter ALL at the “FIRST SEND *\<FILE NAME\>* FIELD:” prompt, if you want to include all fields in the file in your Filegram. ALL can also be used in existing file navigation paths. Enter \[? at this prompt to get a listing of existing [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) for the selected file.

<u>Figure 278</u> shows how two question marks (??) at the “FIRST SEND CHANGE FIELD:” prompt requests a list of the fields in the file.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/212.png) NOTE: You do *not* have to include the .01 field, because it is automatically included for use as a lookup value.

To send logical records in a Filegram, simply use file navigation to and from existing files at the “SEND FIELD:” prompts.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/213.png) REF: For a discussion of relational navigation using forward and backward pointers, see the “<u>Relational Navigation</u>” section.

### Display Filegram Template Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Display Filegram Template \[DIFG DISPLAY\] option displays the [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) in a two-column format (like the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option). Multiple-type fields are shown last in the display, no matter what their field number.

<u>Figure 280</u> is an example of the output produced by the Display Filegram Template option:

The code in the FIRST PRINT FIELD has special meaning to VA FileMan.

### Specifiers Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Filegram sender uses the Specifiers \[DIFG SPECIFIERS\] option to identify a particular field in the file as a reference point to use when installing the Filegram. The value of this field in the Filegram is compared to values in the entries at the target site. The values *must* match for a Filegram to be installed. If the specifier has a unique value for every entry in the file and is cross-referenced, that cross-reference is used to locate an entry. This reduces the search time and increases accuracy. Specifiers can be compared to identifiers: unlike identifiers, which are used for user interaction purposes, specifiers are used for transaction purposes. Specifiers are optional.

The dialog in <u>Figure 281</u> creates a specifier in a sample PATIENT (#2) file:

<span id="_Ref84343277" class="anchor"></span>Figure 281: Filegrams—Example of Creating a Specifier (1 of 2)

Select FILEGRAM OPTION: <span class="mark">5 \<Enter\></span> SPECIFIERS

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PATIENT</span>

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">3 \<Enter\></span> SSN

Want to make SSN a specifier? NO// <span class="mark">YES</span>

Is the value of this field unique for each entry? NO// <span class="mark">YES</span>

Answer YES only if you have a regular cross-reference on the field that you are making a specifier. A field can be a specifier *without* being unique.

If you answer YES, a dialog like <u>Figure 282</u> occurs:

<span id="_Ref389632440" class="anchor"></span>Figure 282: Filegrams—Example of Creating a Specifier (2 of 2)

Select one of the following:

1 C REGULAR

If one of the above provides a direct look-up by SSN, please enter

its number or name: <span class="mark">1</span>

To delete a specifier:

<span id="_Toc342980957" class="anchor"></span>Figure 283: Filegrams—Deleting a Specifier

Select FIELD: <span class="mark">3 \<Enter\></span> SSN

SSN is already a specifier.

Do you want to delete it? NO// <span class="mark">YES</span>

### Generate Filegram Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A Filegram sender uses the Generate Filegram \[DIFG GENERATE\] option. Be sure that the DUZ correctly identifies the Filegram sender; the DUZ is used to identify the Filegram’s sender to the recipient. The option creates a Filegram in MailMan message format after you designate a file, FILEGRAM-type template, and a file entry. Concurrently, it creates a record in the FILEGRAM HISTORY (#1.12) file, which points to the MESSAGE (#3.9) file. The record created in the FILEGRAM HISTORY (#1.12) file is called a Filegram history. The Filegram history allows VA FileMan to differentiate between a Filegram message and a mail message. After the Filegram is placed into the mail message, you can send it to an individual at any established address.

You can only send one entry at a time. <u>Figure 284</u> illustrates the generation of a Filegram:

<span id="_Ref389632473" class="anchor"></span>Figure 284: Filegrams—Example of Generating a Filegram

Select FILEGRAM OPTION: <span class="mark">GENERATE FILEGRAM</span>

Select CHANGE NO.: <span class="mark">334</span>

Send mail to: <span class="mark">SYSTEM,MGR@METRODB.VA.GOV</span>

And send to: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

### Receiving Filegrams with MailMan

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Filegram messages do *not* appear as NEW mail at the receiving site. After the mail message is received, the Filegram recipient *must* read the mail message. Then, it should be forwarded to S.DIFG-SRV-HISTORY on the target system (i.e., the system on which the Filegram is installed). This is a special server used to load the message into the recipient’s FILEGRAM HISTORY (#1.12) file and to set up the interface between VA FileMan and MailMan at the target system.

<u>Figure 285</u> is an example of what the recipient would see when reading and forwarding a Filegram:

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Entries are made into the FILEGRAM HISTORY (#1.12) file at the sending site when the Filegram is generated and at the receiving site by the S.DIFG-SRV-HISTORY server. The View Filegram \[DIFG VIEW\] option allows the Filegram sender or recipient to inspect the Filegram. Select this option and answer the “Select FILEGRAM HISTORY:” prompt with a question mark to get a listing of available Filegram histories. You can see the Filegram history just created by using the \<Spacebar\>\<Enter\> or another Filegram history by entering its internal entry number or date/time.

<u>Figure 286</u> shows you what a simple (*without* pointers) Filegram looks like. The View Filegram \[DIFG VIEW\] option shows this information to a Filegram’s sender. The receiver sees additional information about the transmission of the mail message including the network mail path taken to the target system.

### Install/Verify Filegram Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Filegram recipient uses the Install/Verify Filegram \[DIFG INSTALL\] option to install a Filegram from a MailMan message into a file on the target system. Choose a Filegram history by entering its date/time or by using a \<Spacebar\>\<Enter\> (for the last used history) at the “Select FILEGRAM HISTORY:” prompt. The destination file for the Filegram entry *must* be in place on the target system for a successful installation!

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/214.png) CAUTION: The installation has a better chance of succeeding if the destination file is a replica of the sending file.

The message “DONE” is displayed if the install was successful. If *not* successful, an UNSUCCESSFUL INSTALLATION message is returned with an error code.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/215.png) REF: For a list of error codes identifying their meaning, see “^DIFG” in the “Filegrams API” section in the *VA FileMan Developer’s Guide*.

### Deleting a Filegram

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Delete a Filegram by removing the Filegram’s entry from the FILEGRAM HISTORY (#1.12) file. As shown in <u>Figure 287</u>, use the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option. Enter the at-sign (@) at the DATE/TIME prompt of the Filegram history you want to delete.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/216.png) NOTE: To use VA FileMan’s archiving procedure, Kernel 6.5 or later *must* be installed on your system. To use the Find Archived Records option to retrieve records archived with VA FileMan versions earlier than 20.0, Kernel 7.1 or later *must* be installed on your system.

In general computer terms, archiving is a procedure that permits you to remove data from an online database and place that data into a low-cost storage medium (e.g., magnetic tape) for long-term retention.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/217.png) CAUTION: Archiving in VA FileMan is a complete purge that simply clears data from your system. In other words, no data restoration is provided! However, there is a data retrieval option.

This facility is a prototype and supported only as a developer’s tool. You *must* access your archiving options directly through VA FileMan from Programmer mode. For example:

\>D Q^DI

VA FileMan performs the archiving function by:

1.  Searching through file entries using specified criteria.
48. Extracting and transporting the selected entries by Filegrams to temporary storage in the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file.
49. Simply writing the data to permanent storage.

The FILEGRAM-type template used to transport an archive activity can be created during the archiving session (in the Archiving menu options), or an existing FILEGRAM-type template created using the Filegrams \[DIFG\] menu options can be used.

## Considerations before Archiving

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following summarizes some of the important items to note regarding the archiving facility. Consider them before you begin archiving:

- It is *strongly encouraged* that you to have a current backup of your files before archiving.
- Archiving is *not* user-specific. In other words, archiving is attached to a file *not* a user. For your own protection, be aware that someone other than yourself can complete or change an existing archiving activity.
- Data from logical and physical files can be archived, but only the data from the physical (primary) file can be purged (removed).
- VA FileMan *must* be able to collect and print the data using the search criteria before you can create an archiving activity. The Select Entries to Archive option *must* be run to completion such that the selected entries are printed and can thus be stored in the ^DIBT SORT TEMPLATE global.
- If you plan to keep a hard copy of the printed entries for future reference, design your PRINT template to facilitate review. You do *not* need to print all fields’ values that are archived, but you can include those that, in combination, uniquely identify the entry. Save the PRINT template for future use when archiving.
- When the archived entries are written to temporary storage, the corresponding original entry disappears from the user’s view. (A new node, subscripted with -9, is added to the original entry so that it is bypassed by the usual VA FileMan calls.)
- If data to be archived is contained in a Multiple field, then the entire entry *must* be archived. You *cannot* archive a subentry by itself.
- A [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) is the only template type allowed in the Write Entries to Temporary Storage option.
- You *cannot* have more than one archiving activity on a file at a time.
- Data selected for archiving can be permanently saved to any sequential storage media, for example: SDP, a VMS file, magnetic tape, or a removable disk pack.
- Depending on the number of entries involved, be prepared for the search (the Select Entries to Archive option) and write (the Write Entries to Temporary Storage option) processes to be time-consuming.
- A brief history of who performed the various archive steps and when they were accomplished is saved in the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file.
- You can cancel your archiving process, by using the Cancel Archival Selection option, at any time before the Purge Selected Entries option is used.
- The Find Archived Entries option can be used to verify that the archive medium contains all the information intended to be archived.
- The Purge Selected Entries option completely deletes data from the file being archived and from the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file.
- You *cannot* purge archived entries until you have moved selected entries to permanent storage. Thus, you need *not* worry about losing entries before they are archived.
- You *cannot* start a second archive from a file until you purge or cancel the existing archiving activity on that file.

## Archiving Process, including Archiving Options (1-9)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The order of the options on the Archiving menu reflects the sequence of steps in which you ordinarily do archiving. Access the Archiving menu from the Other Options \[DIOTHER\] menu:

### Select Entries to Archive

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Select Entries to Archive option creates the archiving activity. It is used similarly to the Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] option. The Select Entries to Archive option is the first step in developing an archiving activity and is very important, since there *cannot* be any archiving without the SEARCH template created in this option.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/218.png) TIP: It is important to know which entries you want archived and where you want them stored before you start the archiving process!

This mandatory archiving option really performs three important functions:

1.  A search for file entries that meet your specified search criteria or condition (truth test) occurs first. The results of this search are then stored in a template you specify. You *must* store these results in a template!

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/219.png) REF: For guidance on how to use the search option procedures, see the “Search” section in the *VA FileMan User Manual*.

50. After storing the results of the search in a template, a sort of the file by any field *must* occur. This sort is as important as the search portion of this option! Do *not* use any sort criteria that contains M code. *Be careful*, if you limit the sort range, you limit the entries selected for archiving. You can delete unwanted entries later by using the Add/Delete Selected Entries \[DIAX ADD/DELETE\] option.
51. Finally, a print of the fields to be archived to a printer or the screen (CRT) *must* occur. Printing fields that uniquely identify the entries being archived gives you a *permanent* record of the archived entries.

You *cannot* create an archiving activity until *at least one* entry is located according to your search criteria, sorted, and printed to a printer or a terminal!

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/220.png) NOTE: If a subentry to be archived is contained in a Multiple field, the entire entry *must* be archived.

<u>Figure 289</u> is an example of the dialog that you can encounter. Notice the sequence of search, sort, and print:

After using this option, the status of your archiving activity is SELECTED. The status of an archiving activity can be any of the following:

- SELECTED
- EDITED
- ARCHIVED (TEMPORARY)
- ARCHIVED (PERMANENT)
- PURGED

You can identify a file at the “ARCHIVE FROM WHAT FILE:” prompt and get the response shown in <u>Figure 290</u>:

<span id="_Ref84343433" class="anchor"></span>Figure 290: Archiving—Example of a Notice Regarding an Outstanding Archiving Activity

There is already an outstanding *archiving* activity.

Please finish it or CANCEL it.

This message means that the file you identified has already been selected for archiving and that archiving activity has *not* been completed; a second one *cannot* be started yet. Since the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file is being shared by both archiving and extract activities, the italicized word in the message says *extract* if the outstanding activity on the file identified is an extract.

### Add/Delete Selected Entries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Use the Add/Delete Selected Entries option to add entries to or delete them from the archiving activity. This is an easy way to clear out unwanted entries or add needed ones before archiving.

This option uses the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option to display the selected entries and then allows you to add or delete an entry. If you add or delete an entry to an established archiving activity, then the status of the activity is changed to EDITED.

The Add/Delete Selected Entries option does *not* allow you to edit an archiving activity list after the Write Entries to Temporary Storage option has been done. If you need to change the archiving activity list after writing to temporary storage, you *must* cancel that archiving activity and start a new one.

When using this option, you first select the archiving activity number that you want to modify. You can also identify the archiving activity by its file number or file name. Then, choose the entry that you want to add or delete.

<u>Figure 291</u> is an example in which an entry is being added to the archiving activity:

If you enter two question marks (??) at the prompt where you select the entry for addition or deletion, a list of the file’s entries is displayed. Those that are already part of the archiving activity are identified by “\*ON ARCHIVE LIST\*”. The “ADD this entry TO the ARCHIVAL SELECTION? YES//” question appears if you have selected an entry *not* already on the list for archiving. A “DELETE ...” question appears if you have selected an entry already on the list.

### Print Selected Entries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Print Selected Entries option displays each entry from a selected archiving activity in a regular print or a Filegram format (depending on the template you identify). The archiving activity entries are printed on whatever device you indicate. You can use this option for an archiving activity with any status except PURGED.

<u>Figure 292</u> illustrates the regular print format:

### Create Filegram Archiving Template

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Create Filegram Archiving Template option creates a [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates), which is the template used in the Write Entries to Temporary Storage option. A Filegram is the tool used for extracting and transporting archived data to temporary storage.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/221.png) REF: For further explanation, see the “<u>Write Entries to Temporary Storage</u>” section.

You can create a new [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) with this option or edit an existing one created using the Filegram or Archiving menu options.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/222.png) NOTE: Only those fields defined in the [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates), the .01 field, and any PRIMARY KEY or Identifier fields are archived to permanent storage.  
  
The PRIMARY KEY is available as of VA FileMan 22.0.

You create a [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) just as you create a PRINT template, except only valid field numbers or names can be entered. You *cannot* include print qualifiers. You always get the “STORE FILEGRAM LOGIC IN TEMPLATE:” prompt, no matter how many fields you identify.

[FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) are stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file, so the [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates) is referred to as a PRINT template in the dialog. However, VA FileMan can distinguish between PRINT and FILEGRAM-type templates.

If you want to edit an existing [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates), identify it at the “FIRST SEND FIELD:” prompt by entering “\[Filegram templatename”. Otherwise, specify the fields you want included in the archive. (The .01 field and the file’s PRIMARY KEY and Identifier fields will always be sent.) In the example that follows, all fields are being sent.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/223.png) NOTE: The PRIMARY KEY is available as of VA FileMan 22.0.

<u>Figure 294</u> is an example of creating a [FILEGRAM-type template](#filegram-type-templates):

Are you adding 'CHANGE FILEGRAM' as a new PRINT TEMPLATE? No// <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

### Write Entries to Temporary Storage

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Write Entries to Temporary Storage option writes your selected archiving activities to the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file into a WORD-PROCESSING field. This step is in preparation for moving the data to permanent storage. You *cannot* archive to permanent storage unless you use the Write Entries to Temporary Storage option first. This file could grow quite large and shrinks only after the Purge Selected Entries option has been run.

After using this option, the archived entries appear to be missing from the primary file. This protective measure ensures selected entries *cannot* be edited so that entries in the file match the archived version. The entries are *not* really gone, merely locked.

Also, after using this option, you *cannot* add or delete entries to an archiving activity. If changes in the selection of entries for archiving are necessary, you must cancel this activity and restart.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/224.png) CAUTION: This process can be quite time-consuming! It can be queued at the “DEVICE:” prompt. After it is completed, the status of your archiving activity is ARCHIVED (TEMPORARY).

In <u>Figure 295</u>, the entries in Archiving Activity \#3 are being sent to temporary storage using the ZZTESTFILEGRAM FILEGRAM-type template. The task is being queued with output sent to PRINTER. The resulting report contains a header, dots, and archiving totals, as shown in <u>Figure 295</u>:

4 ITEMS HAVE BEEN ARCHIVED

### Move Archived Data to Permanent Storage

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Once you have written an archiving activity to temporary storage, you can use the Move Archived Data to Permanent Storage option. If you choose an archiving activity that has *not* yet been written to temporary storage, a warning is issued.

This option does several things not necessarily in the order listed here.

1.  Prints an Archive Activity report, which prints information from the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file, such as the archiver (i.e., the person who selected this option), the archival activity number, an index of all archived entries, and the search criteria used during the Select Entries to Archive process, etc.
52. Builds an index of all archived entries and writes this index at the beginning of the archived file. An item in the index contains the .01 value of the entry, along with all PRIMARY KEY and Identifier values for that entry.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/225.png) NOTE: The PRIMARY KEY is available as of VA FileMan 22.0.

53. Prompts for Archive Device Label information. This information usually represents some naming convention that systems managers use as physical label for devices such as tape. If using a disk file, the full disk file name is presented as a default. This device label information, along with the index printed on the Archive Activity report, should be useful in locating an archived entry and the device to which it was archived.
54. Moves archive data to permanent storage. Permanent storage is considered any sequential storage media (e.g., SDP, VMS file, magnetic tape, or disk data set).

You can send to more than one permanent storage location without having to recreate the archiving activity. When the archived data is moved to permanent storage, every line contained in the temporary storage WORD-PROCESSING field is simply read and then written to a sequential medium.

The status of your archiving activity after using this option is ARCHIVED (PERMANENT).

In the example in <u>Figure 296</u>, the archiving activity is identified by file name, “CHANGE.” It is going to be archived to the specified tape:

<span id="_Ref504554356" class="anchor"></span>Figure 296: Archiving—Example of Moving Archived Data to *Permanent* Storage

Select ARCHIVE OPTION: <span class="mark">MOVE \<Enter\></span> ARCHIVED DATA TO PERMANENT STORAGE

Select ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY: <span class="mark">CHANGE \<Enter\></span> 3 CHANGE 08-30-92 ARCHIVED(TEMPORARY) SELECTOR:FMEMPLOYEE,J ARCHIVING

> **NOTE:** This option will 1) print an archive activity report to

specified PRINTER DEVICE and 2) will move archive data to permanent

storage to specified ARCHIVE STORAGE DEVICE.

Select some type of SEQUENTIAL storage media, such as SDP, TAPE, or

DISK FILE (HFS) for archival storage.

PRINTER DEVICE: <span class="mark">PRINTER</span>

ARCHIVE STORAGE DEVICE: <span class="mark">MAGTAPE Parameter ("CAVL":0:2048)</span>

Requested Start Time: NOW// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

ARCHIVE DEVICE LABEL: XXXXV3\$MUA0:ARCHIVE;083092;3// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

If the archive storage device is tape, an archive device label is generated for you, as depicted in the previous example. You can override this label by entering your own device label information.

If you select an archive storage device that is *non*-sequential, a warning is issued. You are then given the option to continue the archiving process.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/226.png) CAUTION: If you specify a device that can be overwritten (e.g., SDP) or that does *not* electronically store data (e.g., a printer), the data is *forever* irretrievable.

Depending on what devices are selected, and whether queueing was requested for either device, different warnings are issued informing the user of either steps they need to take or steps that the program takes because of the queueing request.

### Purge Stored Entries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Before running the Purge Stored Entries option, use the Find Archived Entries option to verify that the archive medium contains the complete archived data for an archiving activity by searching for the last record listed on the index.

This option is used to remove archived data from both the archived file (document example is the CHANGE file) and the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file. A brief history of who performed the various archiving steps and when is saved in the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file.

If you select an archiving activity for purging that has *not* been sent to the archives, then you receive the message shown in <u>Figure 298</u>:

<span id="_Ref389632562" class="anchor"></span>Figure 298: Archiving—Example of a Notice from VA FileMan When Purging without Archiving Data

### Cancel Archival Selection

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Cancel Archival Selection option is used to cancel an archiving activity before the Purge Selected Entries option occurs. You are warned if the archiving activity has already been moved to permanent storage.

When you cancel an archiving activity, the entry in the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file is deleted. Also, entries that were locked after being moved to temporary storage can again be read and edited.

<u>Figure 301</u> shows the dialog for canceling an archival activity:

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/228.png) CAUTION: By answering YES to this prompt, the entries are *immediately* deleted! Be sure this is your decision.

### Find Archived Entries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Find Archived Entries option scans an archive file and retrieves an archive entry (or entries) that match the NAME field (#.01) and/or the PRIMARY KEY and/or Identifier fields of the requested entry. On the prompts for lookup values and on the resulting report, PRIMARY KEY and Identifier fields are both called “Identifiers.” The information contained in the archived entry is printed in CAPTIONED format \[field name (field number) = value\]. This option should only be used with tapes or files archived under VA FileMan 19.0 or later.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/229.png) NOTE: The PRIMARY KEY is available as of VA FileMan 22.0.

Several requests for archived entries can be made at a time. An “(id)” next to a prompt indicates an Identifier, PRIMARY KEY, or Specifier field. One set of all the prompts makes one request.

The matching process is dependent on the presence or absence of an index on the archive file or tape. The matching process for archive files or tapes with no index can be more time-consuming, since it must read the entire archived file to determine all matches. The matching process finds a match when the values of all the answered prompts match that of an archived entry. If a partial value is typed at any prompt, the matching process finds all matches that begin with the partial value for that prompt.

<u>Figure 302</u> shows the dialog for finding archived entries:

### ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The status of an archiving activity is displayed in the listing of activities when a question mark is entered at most of the Archiving options. You can also use the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option on the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file to obtain information about past or pending archiving activities. The amount of information you receive depends on the status of the archiving activity. The ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file contains the following information:

- DUZ of the individual performing the extract activity.
- Status of the extract activity (e.g., EDITED or UPDATED).
- Dates on which the activities were performed.
- Number of entries extracted.
- Source file number.
- SEARCH/SORT and PRINT templates used in the extract activity.

Beginning with VA FileMan 20.0, the ARCHIVAL ACTIVITY (#1.11) file contains data about both archiving and extract activities. A file can have only *one* active activity at a time—either an archiving activity or an extract activity. You can only select an extract activity from the Extract Tool options. When you use the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option, the word EXTRACT appears for all extract activities.

# Meta Data Dictionary

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The META DATA DICTIONARY (#.9) file is a summary of all the VA FileMan files in a VistA installation. It is being provided to enable future development to quickly identify where information is stored within files and fields throughout the VistA system.

<u>Table 98</u> lists the fields in the META DATA DICTIONARY (#.9) file:

| Filed Name and Number         | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NAME (#.01)                   | The NAME field contains the dictionary name followed by the field name with the underscore (\_) connecting the two. If the field is a Multiple, then the Multiple name is included. |
| LOOKUP TERM (#.02)            | The LOOKUP TERM is the final field name.                                                                                                                                                |
| DATA DICTIONARY NUMBER (#.03) | This is the internal entry number (IEN) for the dictionary represented.                                                                                                                 |
| FIELD NUMBER (#.04)           | This is the internal entry number (IEN) for the field represented.                                                                                                                      |
| DATA (#.05)                   | This is an indicator that the field contains data.                                                                                                                                      |
| OBJECT NAME (#.06)            | The OBJECT NAME is a CamelCase representation of the NAME field.                                                                                                                        |
| LAST UPDATED (#.07)           | This indicates the last date/time this field was last edited.                                                                                                                           |

: XU\*8.0\*134

: XU\*8.0\*551 TYPE (c): FREE TEXT

## ^DDD: Initial Creation

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The ^DDD API can be run directly from the M prompt (D ^DDD) or by using the DDU UPDATE META DD option. This API removes all current entries and fully reproduces the Meta Data Dictionary.

## FILELIST^DDD: File List Partial Update

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The FILELIST^DDD API can be run directly from the M prompt. It requires an array by reference that includes files that are to be updated. For example:

<span id="_Toc203327174" class="anchor"></span>Figure 304: FILELIST^DDD API—Example

S ARRAY(2)="" ;PATIENT FILES ARRAY(200)="" ;NEW PERSON FILED FILELIST^DDD(.ARRAY)

## PARTIAL1^DDD: Partial Update using ^DIC(DDD,“%MSC”)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The PARTIAL1^DDD API makes use of the ^DIC(DDD,”%MSC”) data dictionary variable that includes the date that this file was last updated. The PARTIAL1^DDD API updates all files where the ^DIC(DDD,”%MSC”) variable is greater than the date and time stamp that the Meta Data Dictionary was last updated.

![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/230.png) NOTE: Currently, the ^DIC(DDD,”%MSC”) variable is *not* updated for field description changes.

## PARTIAL2^DDD: Partial Update using ^DD(FILE,FIELD,“DT”)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The PARTIAL2^DDD API makes use of the ^DD(FILE,FIELD,"DT") variable that includes the date that the field was last updated. The PARTIAL2^DDD API updates all files where there is a field that the ^DD(FILE,FIELD,"DT") variable is equal to or greater than the date and time stamp that the Meta Data Dictionary was last updated.

# Data Synchronization

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Data Synchronization functionality is designed to be used in association with a Representational State Transfer (REST) service, passed to the Data Synchronization routine to perform automated VA FileMan data dictionary updates.

The main entry point for the Data Synchronization routine is:

EN^DIFSBLD(JSONIN)

There are two portions required by the Data Synchronization routine:

- JSON object entry parameter, JSONIN.
- External disk file that contains the JSON object formatted update data.

## Input JSON Object

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Currently, the JSON object entry parameter should contain two values:

- FULLNAME
- FILENAME

As the project expands more values will be added to the JSON object entry parameter. <u>Figure 305</u> is an example of the JSON object entry parameter.

The JSON object entry parameter should contain the following elements:

- FULLNAME: Contains the full path and file name to the JSON object formatted update data file.
- FILENAME: Contains the file name to the JSON object formatted update data file.

<span id="_Ref490041787" class="anchor"></span>Figure 305: Example of the JSON Object Entry Parameter

{

"FULLNAME":"/home/ftptest/DI_222_6_TEST/Test_03_19100_v5.json",

"FILENAME":"Test_03_19100_v5.json"

}

## Input JSON Data File

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The JSON object formatted update data file should contain the following elements:

- DATABASE: The root identifier for the file.
- FILE: The VA FileMan file being updated.
- RECORD: A JSON array of the individual data objects.

Within each JSON data object, the field names should match the VA FileMan file CamelCased names found in the Meta Data Dictionary. These names are used to cross-reference to the VA FileMan field numbers.

APIs also further DBA goals of system integration by channeling activities, such as adding new users, through a limited number of callable entry points. VistA APIs fall into the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>“Supported API”—</strong>These are callable routines, which are supported for general use by all VistA applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Controlled Subscription API”—</strong>These are callable routines for which you <em>must</em> obtain an Integration Control Registration (ICR; formerly referred to as Integration Agreements [IAs]) to use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Private API”—</strong>Where only a single application is granted permission to use an attribute/function of another VistA package.</p></li>

<p>![](fm-22-2-advanced-user-manual/232.png) CAUTION: Programmer access in VistA is defined as DUZ(0)=“@”. It grants the privilege to become a developer in VistA. Programmer access allows you to work outside many of the security controls enforced by VA FileMan, enables access to all VA FileMan files, access to modify data dictionaries, etc. It is important to proceed with caution when having access to the system in this way.</p></td>

<td><strong>Controlled Subscription Integration Control Registration</strong></td>
<td>This applies where the Integration Control Registration (ICR) describes attributes/functions that <em>must</em> be controlled in their use. The decision to restrict the IA is based on the maturity of the custodian package. Typically, these IAs are created by the requesting package based on their independent examination of the custodian package’s features. For the IA to be approved the custodian grants permission to other VistA packages to use the attributes/functions of the IA; permission is granted on a one-by-one basis where each is based on a solicitation by the requesting package.

<td><p>This term is used to refer to a limited level of access, to a computer system, which is sufficient for using/operating a package, but does <em>not</em> allow programming, modification to data dictionaries, or other operations that require <strong>Programmer</strong> access. Any option, for example, can be locked with the <strong>XUPROGMODE</strong> security key, which means that invoking that option requires <strong>Programmer</strong> access.</p>
<p>The user’s access level determines the degree of computer use and the types of computer programs available. The System Manager assigns the user an access level.</p></td>

<td><strong>Variable</strong></td>
<td><p>Character (or group of characters) that refers to a value. M (previously referred to as MUMPS) recognizes three types of variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Local variables—</strong>Exist in a partition of main memory and disappear at sign-off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Global variables—</strong>Stored on disk, potentially available to any user. Global variables usually exist as parts of global arrays. The term “global” may refer either to a global variable or a global array.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Special variables—</strong>Defined by systems operations (e.g., <strong>$TEST</strong>).</p></li>

<td><strong>Verify Code</strong></td>
<td><p>The Kernel’s Sign-on/Security system uses the Verify Code to validate the user’s identity. This is an additional security precaution used in conjunction with the Access Code. Verify Codes shall be at least <strong>8 characters</strong> in length and contain three of the following four kinds of characters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letters (lowercase)</p></li>
<li><p>Letters (uppercase)</p></li>
<li><p>Numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Characters that are neither letters nor numbers (e.g., <strong>#</strong>, <strong>@</strong>, or <strong>$</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If entered incorrectly, the system does <em>not</em> allow the user to access the computer. To protect the user, both codes are invisible on the terminal screen.</p></td>
