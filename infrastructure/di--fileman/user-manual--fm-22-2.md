What is VA FileMan?

VA FileMan is the database management system for the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture user (VistA) environment. VA FileMan creates and maintains a database management system that includes features such as:

- A report writer
- A data dictionary manager
- Scrolling and screen-oriented data entry
- Text editors
- Programming utilities
- Tools for sending data to other systems
- File archiving

VA FileMan can be used as a:

- Standalone database
- Set of interactive or “silent” routines
- Set of application utilities

In all modes, it is used to define, enter, and retrieve information from a set of computer-stored files, each of which is described by a data dictionary.

VA FileMan is a public domain software package that is developed and maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It is widely used by VA medical centers and in clinical, administrative, and business settings in this country and abroad.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/004.png) CAUTION: Programmer access in VistA is defined as DUZ(0)=“@”. It grants the privilege to become a developer in VistA. Programmer access allows you to work outside many of the security controls enforced by VA FileMan, enables access to all VA FileMan files, access to modify data dictionaries, etc. It is important to proceed with caution when having access to the system in this way.

How to Use this Manual

The VA FileMan User Manual is comprised of two separate documents that describe the VA FileMan functionality of VistA’s database management system:

- The *VA FileMan User Manual* (this manual) introduces basic VA FileMan concepts and shows you how to use VA FileMan’s basic tools for displaying and editing data. It shows you how to use VA FileMan features that are used throughout most VistA applications and used by *all* VistA users.
- The *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual* shows how to use the features of VA FileMan that are likely to be used by experienced VistA users. It introduces advanced VA FileMan concepts and shows you how to use VA FileMan’s advanced tools. It describes features that are more likely to be used by:
- Automated Data Processing Application Coordinators (ADPACs)
- System Administrators
- Other technical users

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/005.png) NOTE: These documents are available in Microsoft Word (.docx), Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format (see the “[HTML Manuals](#html_manuals)” section).

In this manual, the following major features of VA FileMan are introduced along with a description on how to use them:

- <u>Inquire</u>
- <u>Print</u>
- <u>Search</u>
- <u>Browser</u>
- <u>VA FileMan Prompts</u>
- <u>Field Types</u>
- <u>Adding and Deleting Records</u>
- <u>ScreenMan</u>
- <u>Word-Processing Fields</u>
- <u>Screen Editor</u>
- <u>Line Editor</u>

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/006.png) REF: For VA FileMan installation instructions in the VistA environment see the *VA FileMan Installation Guide* and any national patch description of the patch being released.

<span id="html_manuals" class="anchor"></span>HTML Manuals

Why produce an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) edition of the VA FileMan manuals?

- The HTML versions of the VA FileMan manuals are useful as online documentation support as you use VA FileMan. HTML manuals allow you to instantly jump (link) to specific sections, other documents, or references online.
- The VA FileMan HTML manuals are “living” documents that are continuously updated with the most current VA FileMan information (unlike paper or printed documentation). They are updated based on new versions, patches, or enhancements to VA FileMan.
- Presenting manuals in an HTML format online also gives new opportunities, such as accessing embedded multimedia training material (e.g., movies, audio recordings, etc.) directly in the manuals.
- Manuals are accessible over the VA Intranet network.

Intended Audience

The intended audience of this manual is all key stakeholders. The stakeholders include the following:

- General users of the VA FileMan database.
- Automated Data Processing Application Coordinators (ADPACs).
- System Administrators—Personnel at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sites who are responsible for computer management and system security on the VistA M Servers.
- Product Delivery Service (PDS)—VistA legacy development teams.
- Product Support (PS).

<span id="_Ref155612747" class="anchor"></span>Table 2: Print—Sort Qualifiers

- Descriptive text is presented in a proportional font (as represented by this font).
- Conventions for displaying TEST data in this document are as follows:
- The first three digits (prefix) of any Social Security Numbers (SSN) begin with either “000” or “666”.
- Patient and user names are formatted as follows:
- \<Application Name/Abbreviation/Namespace\>PATIENT,\<N\>
- \<Application Name/Abbreviation/Namespace\>USER,\<N\>

Where:

- *\<Application Name/Abbreviation/Namespace\>* is defined in the Approved Application Abbreviations document.
- *\<N\>* represents the first name as a number spelled out and incremented with each new entry.

For example, in Kernel (DI or FM) test patient and user names would be documented as follows:

FMPATIENT,ONE; FMPATIENT,TWO; FMPATIENT,THREE; … FMPATIENT,14; etc.

FMUSER,ONE; FMUSER,TWO; FMUSER,THREE; … FMUSER,14; etc.

- “Snapshots” of computer online displays (i.e., screen captures/dialogs) and computer source code, if any, are shown in a *non*-proportional font and usually enclosed within a box:
- User’s responses to online prompts are bold typeface and highlighted in yellow (e.g., <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>).
- Emphasis within a dialog box is bold typeface and highlighted in blue (e.g.,<span class="mark"> STANDARD LISTENER: RUNNING</span>).
- Some software code reserved/key words are bold typeface with alternate color font.
- References to “\<Enter\>” within these snapshots indicate that the user should press the Enter key on the keyboard. Other special keys are represented within \< \> angle brackets. For example, pressing the PF1 key can be represented as pressing \<PF1\>.
- Author’s comments are displayed in italics or as “callout” boxes.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/012.png) NOTE: Callout boxes refer to labels or descriptions usually enclosed within a box, which point to specific areas of a displayed image.

- All uppercase is reserved for the representation of M code, variable names, or the formal name of options, field/file names, and security keys (e.g., DIEXTRACT).

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/013.png) NOTE: Other software code (e.g., Delphi/Pascal and Java) variable names and file/folder names can be written in lower or mixed case (e.g., CamelCase).

Internal Word Navigation Links Setup Steps

This document uses Microsoft® Word’s built-in navigation for internal hyperlinks. To add Back and Forward navigation buttons to your toolbar for all Word documents, see the *Tech Writer Tips: Internal Word Navigation Links Setup* document.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/014.png) NOTE: This is a one-time setup and is automatically available in any other Word document once you install it on the Toolbar.

How to Obtain Technical Information Online

Exported VistA M Server-based software file, routine, and global documentation can be generated using Kernel, MailMan, and VA FileMan utilities.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/015.png) NOTE: Methods of obtaining specific technical information online is indicated where applicable under the appropriate section.  
  
REF: For further information, see the *VA FileMan Technical Manual*.

Help at Prompts

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) FileMan is the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) MUMPS (M)-based Database Management System (DBMS). The central component that defines the way standard VistA files are structured and manipulated. The majority of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical data is stored in VA FileMan files and is retrieved and accessed through VA FileMan application programming interfaces (APIs) and user interfaces. VA FileMan runs in any American National Standards Institute (ANSI) M environment.

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A computer database, such as VA FileMan, organizes your data, storing it in fields, records, and files, much as you might arrange and preserve information on paper.

A record is a group of fields of data. Each record has a name (e.g., a patient name for a patient record). You can use the record name to recall the record for editing or for printing out. Records are also known as file entries.

For example (<u>Figure 1</u>), a record for a patient might have various fields (e.g., NAME, AGE, ADMISSION DATE, etc.) for a single patient. Each record for a patient would contain the same set of fields (places to fill in information):

<span id="_Ref155623084" class="anchor"></span>Figure 1: Example Showing Several Patient Records

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/019.png)

Each *field* in a record functions just like a blank on a form. When you are editing a record on a terminal, for each field, you get a prompt that tells you what type of data to enter.

VA FileMan uses 16 basic [field types](#field-types). These fields allow you to enter only certain kinds of information, just as a blank on a form might require you to enter only numbers. For example:

- A DATE OF BIRTH field could be set up to record dates/times.
- A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER field could be set up to record a nine-digit number.
- An ADDRESS field could be set up to hold the text of an address.

These three fields are different from one another because of the type of data they store.

All of the records that contain like data are collected and stored in the same *file*. For example, all patient records are stored in the PATIENT (#2) file and all computer user records are stored in the NEW PERSON (#200) file. This way, to look up a patient, you know that the file to go to is the PATIENT (#2) file. Also, to do a report on all patients, you would generate the report from the PATIENT (#2) file.

## Files and the Database

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The database contains all the data files on your computer system:

<span id="_Toc204225743" class="anchor"></span>Figure 2: Representation of a Database

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/020.png)

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/021.png) NOTE: There are many more files than this in VistA databases!

## Printing Records from Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

One way of getting at the information stored in a database is to generate reports that print out selected records. You do *not* have to print *every* field in a record; you can just choose a subset of fields to print out. Nor do you have to print *every* record in a file; there are ways to limit and select what records to print out.

The report in <u>Figure 3</u> displays four records, with one line of output per record, from the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file:

<span id="_Ref389660359" class="anchor"></span>Figure 3: Example of a Printed Report

Internal Entry

Number Name Title

------------- ---------- -------------------

1 ICU Intensive Care Unit

2 CCU Critical Care Unit

5 OR Operating Room

25 1EAST Ward on 1 East

Most applications that use VA FileMan provide a number of already-set-up reports you can quickly choose and print out. In addition, there are options in VA FileMan that allow you to generate your own reports.

This manual contains the following sections on print records from the database:

- <u>Inquire</u>
- <u>Print</u>
- <u>Search</u>
- <u>Browser</u>

## Adding and Editing Records

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

As well as printing records from the database, you can add new records and edit existing records. When you work on the computer system with VistA applications (e.g., Laboratory) most of what you are doing is adding new records and editing existing ones. For example, each new lab result would get stored in a new record; when you make a status change it would be an edit to a field or fields in a patient’s existing record.

Since the bulk of the work you do on the computer system involves working with records, the more you know about using the underlying database system (VA FileMan), the easier it is to do all of your work on the computer system.

This manual contains the following sections on how to edit information in records:

- <u>VA FileMan Prompts</u>
- <u>Field Types</u>
- <u>Adding and Deleting Records</u>
- <u>ScreenMan</u> (editing via forms)
- <u>Word-Processing Fields</u>
- <u>Screen Editor</u> (WORD-PROCESSING fields)
- <u>Line Editor</u> (WORD-PROCESSING fields)

## LAYGO File Access

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In VistA applications, you *not* only display and edit existing records, but also add and delete records from files. For example, you might need to add a new patient to the PATIENT (#2) file. The access to add and delete records can be controlled; however, each VA FileMan file can be set to either allow or *not* allow adding and deleting of new records.

If a file allows records to be added or deleted, it is said to have Learn-As-You-Go (LAYGO) access. To add or delete records, your user account *must* also be set to allow LAYGO access to the file in question. For example, there are certain conditions when you need to specify a particular physician. At that point, you can enter a new physician name, rather than choosing one that already is on file. If you are allowed to add new entries to the file (i.e., you have LAYGO access), the new entry is added to a file of physicians.

## Scrolling Mode vs. Screen Mode

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Many VA VistA application packages have a *Scrolling Mode* interface. Scrolling Mode works as follows:

1.  Computer puts a prompt on the screen.
1.  Users enter a response to the prompt.
2.  Computer places another prompt on the screen, scrolling down one line. Previous prompts move up and eventually off of the screen.

In Scrolling Mode, prompting occurs in the same predetermined order, in a sequence designed by the developer of the application. The user enters, and the computer stores, the responses one at a time. Unless the user is familiar with a few timesaving Scrolling Mode techniques, the user has to step through each prompt in a record before he/she can finish editing the record.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/022.png) REF: For more information on editing records in Scrolling Mode, see the “<u>VA FileMan Prompts</u>” section.

Recently developed VistA applications, on the other hand, often use a Screen Mode interface for editing data. In the Screen Mode approach, each field occupies a fixed position on the screen. The user can see many data fields at once and use simple key combinations to edit data and move from field to field on a screen. The user can also move from one screen to another like turning through the pages of a book. VA FileMan’s screen-oriented data entry tool is called <u>ScreenMan</u>.

In comparing Scrolling Mode with Screen Mode, an area where Screen Mode is much more convenient than Scrolling Mode is text editing. VA FileMan’s Scrolling Mode text editor is the <u>Line Editor</u>. A better choice for editing text is VA FileMan’s Screen Mode editor, the <u>Screen Editor</u>.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/023.png) REF: For more information on the Line Editor, see the “<u>Line Editor</u>” section. For more information on the Screen Editor, see the “<u>Screen Editor</u>” section.

# Inquire

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Overview

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Many reports that you print from applications are pre-designed (i.e., the selection of records) and the fields that print for each record are pre-determined by the application developer. You simply choose the report you would like to print from a menu option, choose an output device, and the selected report prints.

You can also create your own reports, however, if you have either VA FileMan’s print options, or custom-designed application options that take advantage of the same VA FileMan features. This section introduces one of VA FileMan’s print options, Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option.

There are two ways you have an opportunity to use VA FileMan’s inquiry capabilities:

- An option that has been set up already to allow you to inquire to entries from a particular file.
- VA FileMan’s Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option, which lets you inquire to any file to which you have access.

In either case, use of VA FileMan’s inquire feature is very similar. In most cases, the only difference is that with the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option, you have to choose which file to inquire.

## Inquire to File Entries Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The quickest way to display the data for one file entry or for a small number of entries is to use the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option. This option lets you choose a set of entries to display and choose the fields that you want to see for each entry. For example:

<span id="_Toc204225745" class="anchor"></span>Figure 4: Inquire—Dialog Using the Inquire to File Entries Option: Sample User Entries at Prompts and Sample Report

### Standard Caption Output

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Choosing Standard Captioned Output can be very useful; it prints out *all* fields (that contain data) for each entry in the report. Use it is a quick way to select all the fields for each entry in the report. Otherwise, you need to select each field to print individually, from the list of fields available to print in the file. Answering YES to use STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT is the fastest way to choose what fields to print.

#### Computed Fields

When using Standard Captioned Output, you can choose from the following at the “Include COMPUTED Fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO//” prompt:

- N (default)—NO - No record number (IEN), no Computed Fields
- Y—Computed Fields
- R—Record Number (IEN)
- B—BOTH Computed Fields and Record Number (IEN)

The default is to display neither. Enter two question marks (??) for detailed help about responding to this prompt.

#### Audit Trails

If one or more of the fields have been audited, the system displays the “DISPLAY AUDIT TRAIL?” prompt. If you answer YES, then you see the changes that have been recorded for the various fields in the AUDIT (#1.1) file, along with the current values of the fields.

## SORT Templates

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you choose several entries to display, you are prompted with the following:

<span id="_Toc204225746" class="anchor"></span>Figure 5: Inquire—Prompt to Store Entries into a Template

STORE THESE ENTRY ID’s IN A TEMPLATE:

You can *save* your list of selected entries in a SORT template by entering a template name at this prompt. Your list of entries is then saved in a SORT template. You can then *reuse* the list of selected entries in the template when you do additional printing from this file in the future.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/024.png) REF: For more information on using SORT templates, see the “<u>Saving Sort Criteria (SORT Templates)</u>” section.

## Choose Your Own Print Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/025.png) CAUTION: Do *not* use STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT.

To choose your own fields to output for each entry, answer NO to the “STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?” prompt. You can then choose your own output fields. For example, if you only need NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, and PROVIDER information about a selected patient, you could request it, as shown in <u>Figure 6</u>.

## Choose Your Own Device

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/027.png) CAUTION: Do *not* use STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT.

If you enter YES at the “STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?” prompt, output is sent to the HOME device, which ordinarily is the terminal you are using. To send output to a printer, you need to answer NO at the “STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?” prompt. This means you *must* choose your own print fields, as described in Section <u>2.4</u>, “<u>Choose Your Own Print Fields</u>.” Doing this allows you to select the output device, however.

If you answer NO to the “STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?” prompt, you can still get CAPTIONED output, however. To do this, choose the CAPTIONED PRINT template at the first “PRINT FIELD:” prompt, as shown in <u>Figure 7</u>.

Enter the left bracket “\[” and the word CAPTIONED. CAPTIONED OUTPUT from the template works exactly as if you had answered YES at the “STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?” prompt to request CAPTIONED OUTPUT.

## How to Print Reports from Files

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

With the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option, you can:

1.  Select entries from a file, one by one.
3.  Choose a format for displaying the selected entries.
4.  Output the selected entries.

VA FileMan’s print capabilities, on the other hand, allow you to select entries, *not* one by one, but instead by choosing a range of entries based on the sorting order. You can choose all entries in a file, for example, and sort them in alphabetical order for the printout. Alternatively, you can choose all entries sorting between E and F and sort them in alphabetical order for the printout.

## VA FileMan’s Print Capabilities

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

There are two ways in which you have an opportunity to use VA FileMan’s print capabilities:

- An option that has been set up already to allow you to print from a particular file.
- VA FileMan’s Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\] option, which lets you print from any file to which you have access.

In either case, use of VA FileMan’s print features is very similar. In most cases, the only difference is that with the Print File Entries \[DIPRINT\], you have to choose from which file to print.

Unlike the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option, which displays individual records, VA FileMan’s print can list all records in a file. Thus, the focus of the Inquire to File Entries \[DIINQUIRE\] option is a single or small group of entries while VA FileMan’s prints are concerned with the entire file.

VA FileMan’s print features allow considerable flexibility in:

- Selecting entries.
- Ordering (or sorting) the entries selected.
- Choosing which fields to display.
- Formatting the output.

The following two basic components can be used to create a report:

- “SORT BY:” dialog. Used to sort (and sometimes narrow down) the entries that you want displayed.
- “PRINT FIELD:” dialog. Used to choose the fields you want and the format of their display.

The choices you can make at these two prompts are discussed in detail later in this section.

## Standard Column Format for VA FileMan Prints

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan has a standard, columnar format for print output. The file name, current date/time, and page number appear at the top of each report page, followed by column headings that correspond to the labels of selected fields. There are many ways to customize the format, as shown in <u>Figure 8</u>:

<span id="_Ref446146148" class="anchor"></span>Figure 8: Print—Example of a Standard Printout

NAME SEX

---------------------------------------------------------------------

FMPATIENT,SEVEN MALE

FMPATIENT,EIGHT MALE

FMPATIENT,NINE MALE

FMPATIENT,10 FEMALE

This simple example of a report (<u>Figure 8</u>) is generated by the dialog in <u>Figure 9</u>. It prints information from all the entries in the PATIENT (#2) file, ordered by NAME (#.01) field. Only data from the NAME and SEX fields are printed, as requested at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompts:

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/028.png) NOTE: You would have received information about every patient in the file, *not* just these four. You could have asked for several more fields to be printed. They would appear as columns of output, left to right, in the order specified.

## Sorting

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Specifying SORT BY Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Sorting determines the *order* that records are printed in your reports. You can accept the default order (by the .01 field), or you can specify your own sorting order. The sort can be a simple sort, based on only one field, or you can sort based on the values of several fields.

For example, if you want to print the entries in order from oldest to youngest patient, you could sort the report by date of birth (the DATE OF BIRTH field in the PATIENT \[#2\] file), as shown in <u>Figure 10</u>:

<span id="_Ref345588324" class="anchor"></span>Figure 10: Print—Dialog for Specifying a Sort Order for a Printed Report: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select VA FileMan Option: <span class="mark">PRINT \<Enter\></span> File Entries

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: PATIENT// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

SORT BY: NAME// <span class="mark">DATE OF BIRTH</span>

START WITH DATE OF BIRTH: FIRST// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

WITHIN DATE OF BIRTH, SORT BY: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME</span>

1 NAME

2 NAME COMPONENTS

3 NAME ORDER

CHOOSE 1-3: <span class="mark">1 \<Enter\></span> NAME

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">SEX</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DEVICE: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> SSH VIRTUAL TERMINAL Right Margin: 80// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

The output then prints in the following order (by DATE OF BIRTH), as shown in <u>Figure 11</u>:

<span id="_Ref490833751" class="anchor"></span>Figure 11: Print—Example of a Printed Report in a Specific Order

PATIENT LIST FEB 12, 2013 19:11 PAGE 1

NAME SEX

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF BIRTH: OCT 14, 1877

FMPATIENT,12 FEMALE

DATE OF BIRTH: NOV 3, 1922

FMPATIENT,13 MALE

DATE OF BIRTH: APR 4, 1933

FMPATIENT,NINE MALE

If you sort by a field that is *not* a print field, then it is displayed as a subheader. In <u>Figure 11</u>, the sort criterion (DATE OF BIRTH) is printed as a subheader with every change in sort value.

To suppress the printing of sort values (subheaders) in the body of your report, you can either:

- Add the field you are sorting by to the print field list.
- Place an at-sign (@) in front of the field label at the “SORT BY:” prompt. In the previous example (<u>Figure 11</u>), you would sort by @DATE OF BIRTH instead of DATE OF BIRTH.

### Sorting Order

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The ordering of entries within a sort is generally from low value to high value. Some special cases for specific data type field values include:

- SET OF CODES—Field values are sorted by the internally stored code, *not* the value that is output.
- FREE TEXT—Field values usually sort from lowest value to highest value following the ASCII sorting sequence. Digits sort before uppercase letters, which sort before lowercase letters (e.g., M1 sorts before MC which sorts before Mc).

#### Sorting Canonic Numbers and *Non*-Canonic Strings, and the ;TXT Sort Qualifier

Canonic numbers are pure numbers that do *not* have leading Zeroes before or trailing Zeroes after a decimal point. Thus, 1.1 is a canonic number but 01.1 and 1.10 are *not*. A *non*-canonic string is everything else. For example, “8C” is a *non*-canonic string.

This distinction is important when sorting, because in all VA FileMan sorting, *canonic numbers sort first*, and everything else sorts second. Usually, this works very well. But in a few cases where sort fields contain a mix of canonic numbers and *non*-canonic strings, unexpected sort orders result. Classic cases include sorting on Social Security Numbers and on ward locations.

Consider Social Security Numbers (SSNs). The SSNs 666333333 and 666999900 are canonic numbers. But the SSN 000769000 is *not* a canonic number, because of its leading Zeroes. When you use the default sort based on SSN, you get output that looks like <u>Figure 12</u>Figure 12:

<span id="_Ref523989248" class="anchor"></span>Figure 12: Print—Sorting Canonic and Non-Canonic Numbers

PATIENT LIST JUL 19,1996 11:36 PAGE 1

SSN NAME

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

666333333 FMPATIENT,13

666999900 FMPATIENT,14

000769000 FMPATIENT,15

In this example (<u>Figure 12</u>), you see that SSN 000769000 is *non*-canonic due to its leading Zeroes, so it sorts *after* SSN 666999900, which is canonic.

A similar situation occurs when you sort on ward locations. Suppose you have wards 8, 8C, and 9. Wards 8 and 9 are canonic numbers, while ward 8C is a *non*-canonic string. Thus, if you sort on ward location, your output comes out in this order: 8, 9, 8C.

To avoid this problem, use the sort qualifier “;TXT” on your sort field. This forces all field values to be *non*-canonic, with the result that a group of strings like 8, 8C, and 9 sort in the expected order.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/029.png) REF: For more information on the “;TXT” sort qualifier, see the list of Sort Qualifiers in <u>Table 2</u>.

#### Sorting to Select Entries for Printing

Besides using sorting to determine the *order* of entries printed, you can also use the “START WITH ...:” prompt to restrict what entries are printed to a range. For example, if you accept the default sort range (from first to last), you can get a report with every item in the file listed. You can cut this list down to a subset of the entries in the file by how you sort (e.g., entries that sort from FMPATIENT,A to FMPATIENT,Z only).

To specify a sort range, enter the range starting point at the “START WITH...:” prompt, and the range end point at the “GO TO...:” prompt. For example:

<span id="_Toc204225754" class="anchor"></span>Figure 13: Print—Specifying a Sort Range

SORT BY: NAME// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

START WITH NAME: FIRST// <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,A</span>

GO TO NAME: LAST// <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,Z</span>

#### Selecting All Entries with the Same Value for One Field

A simple kind of selecting can be done to choose only those entries that have a particular value for a field. For example, to list only those patients who have a DIAGNOSIS equal to CANCER, you can sort as shown in the example in <u>Figure 14</u>Figure 14:

<span id="_Ref472422752" class="anchor"></span>Figure 14: Print—Choosing Entries with a Specific Value

START WITH DIAGNOSIS: FIRST// <span class="mark">CANCER</span>

GO TO DIAGNOSIS: LAST// <span class="mark">CANCER</span>

#### Other Ways of Selecting Entries

The “START WITH ... GO TO ...” dialog can be used to do sophisticated selecting from a file. Computed expressions can be entered at the prompts to filter the entries to be printed.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/030.png) REF: These powerful techniques are discussed in the “Computed Expressions” section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual*.

You can also use VA FileMan’s search functions to select entries for printing.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/031.png) REF: For more information on VA FileMan’s search functions, see the “<u>Search</u>” section.

#### Including Entries with NULL Fields in Your Sort (Start with @)

When you sort a report on a particular field, if any record in the file has *no value* in that field (i.e., NULL) that record is *skipped* and *not printed*, if you accept the default sort start value (FIRST). In other words, in a print from the PATIENT (#2) file, if you sort on the PROVIDER field, start sorting from the default of FIRST, and there are some patients with nothing in their PROVIDER field (i.e., NULL), those patients are left off the report entirely.

If you want to include records in your report, even if they have no value in the field on which you are sorting (i.e., NULL), sort from @ instead of accepting the default of FIRST. As shown in <u>Figure 15</u>, the user entered an at-sign (@) at the “START WITH PROVIDER: FIRST” prompt:

#### Sort Qualifier Reference

As well as entering fields to sort by, you can also enter formatting controls in the “SORT BY:” dialog. Add these qualifiers to the field label or to the computed expression you are entering at the “SORT BY:” prompt.

#### Sort Qualifiers to Use at “SORT BY:” Prompts

<u>Table 2</u> lists the sort qualifiers you can use at the “SORT BY:” prompts:

<td><strong>#field</strong></td>
<td>Page break when sort value changes</td>
<td>Starts a new page every time the value of the sorted field changes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>‘field</strong></td>
<td>Specify a range for output without sorting</td>
<td><p>This lets you <em>select</em> entries based on this field in the <strong>“START WITH . . . GO TO</strong> . . .” dialog, but <em>not sort</em> based on the field.</p>
<p>![](fm-22-2-user-manual/032.png) <strong>NOTE:</strong> Since sorting requires substantial system resources, do <em>not</em> sort entries unnecessarily.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>+field</strong></td>
<td>Subtotal within a SORT BY field</td>
<td><p>When subtotaling, you indicate in the “PRINT FIELD” dialog the fields to be enumerated. All requested numeric operations (sum, count, etc.) are done as a subtotal when the SORT BY field changes in addition to the grand totals at the end.</p>
<p>You can sub-subtotal by adding a prefix of <strong>+</strong> to <strong>two</strong> fields in the “SORT BY:” dialog. For example:</p>
<p>SORT BY: <strong>+REGION</strong></p>
<p>WITHIN REGION, SORT BY: <strong>+STORE</strong></p>
<p>This produces subtotals for each STORE within the subtotals for each REGION.</p></td>

</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>@field</strong></td>
<td>Suppress the printing of subheader</td>
<td>Normally, a subheader with the value of the SORT BY field name is printed for SORT BY fields, if the field is <em>not</em> also specified as a print field. Using an at-sign (<strong>@</strong>) suppresses those subheaders.</td>

<tr class="odd">

<td>The number (<em><strong>n</strong></em>) indicates the column to begin the subheader.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>field;L<em>n</em></strong></td>
<td>Use less than the entire sort field for sorting</td>
<td><p>The <strong>;L</strong> suffix lets you specify that only the first “<em><strong>n</strong></em>” characters of the field used to sort. Thus, if you specify:</p>
<p>SORT BY: <strong>NAME;L2</strong></p>
<p>Only the first <strong>two</strong> letters of the name field are used for sorting: the order of “<strong>FMEMPLOYEE,TWENTY</strong>” and “<strong>FMEMPLOYEE,ONE</strong>”, for example, is unpredictable in your output.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>field;</strong><strong>P<em>a</em>-<em>b</em></strong></td>
<td>Store sort range for display</td>
<td><p>The <strong>;P</strong> suffix saves the “<strong>START WITH</strong>” and “<strong>GO TO</strong>” sort range for one level of sort fields, for later reference at a “PRINT FIELD” prompt. You can substitute any string (up to <strong>60 characters</strong> in length) for “<strong>a</strong>” and “<strong>b</strong>” in “<strong>;Pa-b</strong>”. Whatever strings you use as “<strong>a</strong>” and “<strong>b</strong>” (e.g., <strong>FROM</strong> and <strong>TO</strong>) become subscripts of the PARAM() array:</p>
<p>SORT BY: <strong>NAME;PFROM-TO</strong></p>
<p>START WITH NAME: FIRST// <strong>C</strong></p>
<p>GO TO NAME: LAST// <strong>D<em>zzzzz</em></strong></p>
<p>Then at a “PRINT FIELD” prompt, you can reference the saved values by using <strong>PARAM(“a-string”)</strong> and <strong>PARAM(“b-string”)</strong>. Thus, in this case:</p>
<p>THEN PRINT FIELD: <strong>PARAM(“FROM”)</strong></p>
<p>THEN PRINT FIELD: <strong>PARAM(“TO”)</strong></p>
<p>The sort-from and sort-to values of “<strong>C</strong>” and “<strong>D<em>zzzzz</em></strong>” in the report would then print in the appropriate location. The typical reason to save sort values and then retrieve them from the <strong>PARAM</strong> array in a print field, is for custom report headers (which are created as <strong>PRINT</strong> templates). It is one method to print sort criteria in the report header.</p>
<p>If you need to sort on <em>two or more</em> fields, you need to use a different string for “<em><strong>a</strong></em>” and “<em><strong>b</strong></em>” at each level, or else the values overwrite each other.</p>
<p>![](fm-22-2-user-manual/033.png) <strong>NOTE:</strong> No value is saved in the <strong>PARAM</strong> array if the user accepts “FIRST” or “LAST” as the “START WITH” or “GO TO” sort values; the PARAM array is <strong>NULL</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>field;Sn</strong></td>
<td>Skip lines when sort value changes</td>
<td><p>The <strong>;S</strong> suffix skips one line between sort field values, if no number is added. If you specify a number (“<strong>n</strong>”), <strong>n-</strong>lines are skipped. You can use this qualifier to skip lines after subtotals are printed by inserting the following after the last subtotaled field:</p>
<p>WITHIN X, SORT BY: <strong>@“”;S</strong></p>
<p>START WITH ““: FIRST// <strong>@</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>GO TO “<strong>”</strong>: LAST// <strong>@<br />
</strong></p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>field;TXT</strong></td>
<td>Sort numbers as text</td>
<td>The <strong>;TXT</strong> sort qualifier forces digits to be sorted as alphanumeric strings, <em>not</em> as numbers (“<strong>22</strong>” sorts before “<strong>3</strong>”). Use this to correctly sort mixed canonic and <em>non</em>-canonic numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>field<strong>;”xxx”</strong></td>
<td>Replace caption in subheader and sort dialog</td>
<td><p>The default subheader is the field label or expression entered at the “SORT BY:” prompt. The same string is used within the sort dialog. You can substitute a string of your choosing by adding a semicolon (<strong>;</strong>) and text enclosed in quotation marks. For example:</p>
<p>SORT BY: DATE OF BIRTH;“Birthdate: <strong>”</strong></p>
<p>To suppress the caption in the subheader, enter <strong>two</strong> double quotes after the semicolon:</p>
<p>SORT BY: DATE OF BIRTH;“”</p>
<p>The specified caption is also used in the subsequent sort dialog. This is useful in simplifying the sort dialog when a field label is confusing, is concatenated, or is an extended pointer. For example:</p>
<p>SORT BY: <strong>STORE:REGION;”Location:”</strong></p>
<p>START WITH Location: FIRST// <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong></p>
<p>WITHIN Location, SORT BY: <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong></p>
<p>PRINT FIELD: <strong>STORE</strong></p>
<p>THEN PRINT FIELD: <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Location:</strong>” is substituted for “<strong>STORE:REGION</strong>”.</p></td>

#### Saving Sort Criteria (SORT Templates)

You can save your sort criteria in a SORT template. This lets you reuse the same sorting instructions in future prints from the current file. SORT templates are stored in the SORT TEMPLATE (#.401) file. If you sort by more than three fields, you are asked whether you want to store your sort criteria in a SORT template, as shown in <u>Figure 17</u>.

#### Forcing Creation of a SORT Template

Ordinarily, you are only asked whether to save your sort criteria in a SORT template if you enter three or more fields at the “SORT BY:” prompts. However, to force this question to be asked, enter a right bracket ( \] ) by itself at one “SORT BY:” prompt. No matter how few fields you sort by you are still prompted to save your sort criteria in a SORT template.

#### Reusing Sort Criteria in New Reports

The reason to save sort criteria in a SORT template is so that you can *reuse* your sort criteria in a new report from the same file.

To reuse a SORT template as the sort criteria in a new report, at the “SORT BY:” prompt in the new report, enter a left bracket ( \[ ) plus the template name:

### Choosing Print Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Specifying Fields to Print

After you have specified the order in which the output should occur, you are asked to list the fields you want displayed for each file entry. In the simplest case, fields are identified by their label. If you enter a single question mark (?) at the prompt, a list of all the fields in the file is displayed. If you enter the name of a Multiple, you are asked for the subfields you want printed. A subfield *must* be specified even if the Multiple has only one subfield.

To print all fields in the file, enter ALL (uppercase) at the “FIRST PRINT FIELD:” prompt. You are then prompted:

<span id="_Toc204225761" class="anchor"></span>Figure 20: Print—Confirmation Message to Print All Fields

Do you mean ALL the fields in the file? NO//

Enter YES to indicate all fields; otherwise, the file is searched for field labels beginning with the letters “ALL”.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/034.png) NOTE: Fields from other files can also be printed using extended pointers. This technique is described in the “Using Computed Expressions in COMPUTED Fields” section in the “Computed Expressions” section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual*. You can also enter other computed expressions, which are also described in that section.

#### Print Qualifier Reference

VA FileMan’s print capabilities provide many ways to format a report. If you do *not* specify any formatting controls, a format is constructed automatically. The width of each field’s print area is computed using information from the field’s definition. The default width is the larger of the following in the print dialog:

- Maximum number of characters allowed for the field.
- Length of the longest word of the field’s label (or other specification).

Two inter-column spaces are added to separate fields.

By using print qualifiers at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompt, for each field, you can indicate:

- How long the field’s print area should be.
- Where it should start.
- How many lines to skip before printing the field.
- Column title for the field.
- Insert literal strings within the output.

For fields that have numeric values, you can call for several arithmetic calculations and indicate the number of decimal digits of accuracy. If you have requested subtotals in the sort dialog (by preceding the field with a +), calculations are done at the subtotal level as well.

#### Print Qualifiers to use at “PRINT FIELD:” Prompts

<u>Table 3</u> lists the print qualifiers you can use at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompts:

You <em>cannot</em> use <strong>;S</strong> with a <strong>WORD-PROCESSING</strong>-type field.

<td>The <strong>;W</strong> suffix splits a field that is too long for its field column width at word boundaries (spaces) and prints it out fully on <strong>two</strong> or more rows. You can optionally follow the <strong>;W</strong> with the number of column positions to be occupied by each line of output. If the field’s data dictionary definition says to always print in word-wrap mode, DATA TYPE field values of <strong>WORD-PROCESSING</strong> are automatically wrapped.

<td>Suppress header and inter-column spaces</td>
<td>Follow the field specification with <strong>;X</strong> to suppress the <strong>two spaces</strong> normally inserted before a field and the column header for the field.

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>field;”<em>xxx</em>”</strong></td>
<td>Customize header</td>
<td><p>The default header for columns of a report is the field label (for fields) or a computed expression (for “on-the-fly” computed expressions). To change the header, follow the field label with a semicolon (<strong>;</strong>) and the column header you want. Enclose the header in quotes. When possible, spaces wrap the substitute header within a print width obtained from the field’s data definition. For example:</p>
<p>THEN PRINT FIELD: <strong>DOB;”Date of Birth”</strong></p>
<p>THEN PRINT FIELD: <strong>DOB;”Date_of_Birth”</strong></p>
<p>The first specification prints the header on <strong>two</strong> lines; the second prints it on <strong>one</strong> line (with underscores). To suppress the header, add <strong>; “”</strong> to the field.</p>

</table>

<span id="_Ref155592107" class="anchor"></span>Table 4: Search—Condition Tests

You can string together several of these print qualifiers at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompt. For example:

<span id="_Toc204225762" class="anchor"></span>Figure 21: Print—Stringing Several Print Qualifiers Together

THEN PRINT FIELD: +WEIGHT;S1;C3;L6;”Patient Weight”

These specifications translate to: total, count, and give the mean for all values of the WEIGHT field, which *must* be a NUMERIC valued field. Skip one line before printing the values. Start the output in column three, left justify and truncate it to six character positions, and print the column heading “Patient Weight” on two lines.

#### Saving Print Criteria (PRINT Templates)

PRINT templates let you store your print field specifications for use later. You can retrieve the template later by using the template name surrounded by square brackets ( \[ \] ). Template names *must* be unique with respect to any other PRINT template created for the same file. VA FileMan notifies you if you try to create a template with a template name that already exists for a file. PRINT templates are stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file.

To see a list of all existing templates that pertain to the file you are dealing with, enter a left bracket and a question mark (\[?) at the prompt where you can retrieve templates. For example:

<span id="_Toc204225763" class="anchor"></span>Figure 22: Print—Obtaining a List of All PRINT Templates for a File

FIRST PRINT FIELD: \[?

This gives you a list of the PRINT templates available for your use with the file.

You are automatically prompted for a template name when it is determined that a considerable amount of information has been specified. If you choose five or more print fields, or if some of your print fields have special formatting specifications, you are prompted to store your print field specification in a PRINT template, as follows:

<span id="_Toc204225764" class="anchor"></span>Figure 23: Print—Creating a PRINT Template

STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE:

If you do *not* want to store your specifications in a template, simply press the Enter key. If you do want to save these print specifications for future reuse, however, respond to this prompt with the name of a template (either new or existing). Do *not* enclose the name in brackets; use brackets only to invoke a template, *not* to name one.

#### Forcing Creation of a PRINT Template

Ordinarily, you are only asked whether you want to save your PRINT template if you enter five or more fields at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompt or enter complex print specifications. However, by entering a right bracket ( \] ) by itself at one of your field prompts, you can force the prompt that asks you for a template name, no matter how few fields you specify. You *must* designate at least one field to be printed to receive the template prompt, though.

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225765" class="anchor"></span>Figure 24: Print—Forcing the Creation of a PRINT Template

PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\] \<Enter\></span>

PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

HEADING: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: <span class="mark">ID PRINT</span>

#### Using and Editing PRINT Templates

If a PRINT template has already been defined for a file, you can answer the “FIRST PRINT FIELD:” prompt with the template name, enclosed within square brackets ( \[ \] ). For example:

<span id="_Ref490837427" class="anchor"></span>Figure 25: Print—Reusing a PRINT Template

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\[PATIENT DATA\]</span>

WANT TO EDIT ‘PATIENT DATA’ TEMPLATE? NO// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

NAME: PATIENT DATA// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

READ ACCESS: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

WRITE ACCESS: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

After you retrieve a template, you are asked if you want to edit the template. If you answer YES (as shown in <u>Figure 25</u>), you are allowed to edit the template name. To delete the template, enter an at-sign (@). After the “NAME:” prompt, you can edit the template security codes for READ and WRITE access.

Next, you are prompted to edit each “PRINT FIELD:” value, containing each print field stored in the template. You can leave each print field as is, edit it, or delete it with the at-sign character (@).

To insert a new print field ahead of the print field being displayed in your template, precede the print field you want to insert with a caret (^). See the example in <u>Figure 26</u> of adding to a PRINT template (INPUT and SORT templates have this feature also):

<span id="_Ref389661454" class="anchor"></span>Figure 26: Print—Inserting a New Print Field

FIRST PRINT FIELD: FIELD1// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD2// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD4// <span class="mark">^FIELD3</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD4// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

To insert a Multiple field and its subfields ahead of the field currently displayed in the template, do the following:

1.  Enter a caret (^) followed by the name of the Multiple field.
5.  Ignore the default presented at the “THEN PRINT FIELD:” prompt and insert each subfield by entering a caret (^) followed by the name of that subfield.
6.  After all subfields have been added, enter a caret (^) and a right bracket (^\]).

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225768" class="anchor"></span>Figure 27: Print—Inserting a Multiple Print Field

FIRST PRINT FIELD: FIELD1// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD2// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD3// <span class="mark">^MultField \<Enter\></span> (multiple)

THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// <span class="mark">^SubField1</span>

THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// <span class="mark">^SubField2</span>

THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// <span class="mark">^\]</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD3//

#### CAPTIONED PRINT Template: \[CAPTIONED

Every file has a pre-defined CAPTIONED PRINT template that you can select at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompt. The CAPTIONED PRINT template can be very useful; it prints out all fields for each entry in your report. Use it is a quick way to get all the fields for each entry in your report (much quicker than entering each field individually)!

Use it as follows:

<span id="_Toc204225769" class="anchor"></span>Figure 28: Print—Choosing a CAPTIONED PRINT Template

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\[CAPTIONED</span>

#### COMPUTED Fields and Record Numbers in CAPTIONED OUTPUT

When you choose the CAPTIONED PRINT template, you are prompted with “Include COMPUTED fields”. At this prompt, you can decide whether to include COMPUTED-type fields in the output for each record, as well as record numbers.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/037.png) REF: For more information on COMPUTED fields, see the “COMPUTED Data Type” section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual*.

<span id="_Toc204225770" class="anchor"></span>Figure 29: Print—Dialog Encountered when Creating a Captioned Print Report

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\[CAPTIONED</span>

Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// <span class="mark">?</span>

Enter a code from the list.

Select one of the following:

N NO - No record number (IEN), no Computed Fields

Y Computed Fields

R Record Number (IEN)

B BOTH Computed Fields and Record Number (IEN)

Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// <span class="mark">BOTH \<Enter\></span> Computed Fields and Record Number (IEN)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Heading (S/C): NEW PERSON LIST// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

DEVICE: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

#### Printing Statistics Only (Totals, Counts, etc.)

If you precede *all* of the fields that you choose for printing at the “PRINT FIELD:” prompts with a +, &, !, or \#, the individual field values are *not* printed in your report. Instead, you only get the requested statistics, which (depending on the print qualifiers and fields used) can be the total, count, mean, maximum, minimum, and/or standard deviation.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/038.png) REF: For more information about print qualifiers, see the “<u>Print Qualifier Reference</u>” section.

### Other Print Features

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Other print features include:

- [Multiple Copies of a Print](#_Ref155591534)
- [Report Headings](#report-headings)
- [Suppressing Report Headings (and Page Feeds)](#_Ref155591563)
- [Custom Headings and Footers](#_Ref155591587)
- [Printing Sort Criteria in the Heading or the Footer](#_Ref155591610)

#### Multiple Copies of a Print

To generate more than one copy of a report, you *must* have an output device on your system (e.g., a spool device or a sequential disk processor \[SDP\]), which stores data in a linear format. If you choose to send the output to such a device at the “DEVICE:” prompt, the system prompts you as shown in <u>Figure 30</u>:

<span id="_Ref490837707" class="anchor"></span>Figure 30: Print—Generating Multiple Copies of a Report

ENTER NUMBER OF COPIES: <span class="mark">4</span>

OUTPUT COPIES TO DEVICE: <span class="mark">PRINTER</span>

In this example (<u>Figure 30</u>Figure 30), you are asking to print four copies to the device called PRINTER.

You *must* be using VA FileMan with Kernel or with a device handler similar to Kernel’s to produce multiple copies. If you exceed the maximum spool lines allowed, as defined in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS (#8989.3) file, your report is stopped.

#### Report Headings

The heading in a report is what is printed at the top of each report page. Ordinarily, it includes the following, as shown in <u>Figure 31</u>:

- Heading (report title)
- Date of report
- Time of report
- Page number
- Column headers (field titles for fields in the output)

<span id="_Ref490837828" class="anchor"></span>

Figure 31: Print—Example of a Report Heading

PATIENT LIST JUL 19,1996 14:49 PAGE 1

SSN NAME

-------------------------------------------------------------------

You can customize the report heading when you print. If you ask for help at the “Heading (S/C):...” prompt, VA FileMan displays the instructions shown in <u>Figure 32</u>:

<span id="_Ref345588354" class="anchor"></span>Figure 32: Print—Dialog to Customize Report Headings: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <span class="mark">?</span>

There are two different options:

1\) Accept the default heading or enter a custom heading.

For no heading at all, type @.

To use a Print Template for the heading, type \[TEMPLATE NAME\].

2\) Replace the default heading with:

S to Suppress the heading when there are no records to print, and/or

C to print sort Criteria in the heading.

If S and/or C is entered, the heading prompt will re-appear.

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <span class="mark">CS</span>

\*\* Suppress the heading when there are no records to print.

\*\* print sort Criteria in heading.

Heading: PATIENT LIST//

Thus, at the “Heading (S/C):” prompt, you can:

- Enter S to *not* print the heading (i.e., *not* print anything), if no records are found to print.
- Enter C to print sort criteria in the report heading on the first page.
- Enter a new heading to replace the default heading or press the Enter key to accept the default heading.

#### Suppressing Report Headings (and Page Feeds)

If you do *not* want headings to be printed in your output, enter an at-sign (@) at the “HEADING:” prompt:

<span id="_Toc204225774" class="anchor"></span>Figure 33: Print—Suppressing Headings on a Report

HEADING: PATIENT LIST// <span class="mark">@</span>

If you want neither headings nor page feeds in your output, enter two at-signs (@@) at the “HEADING:” prompt.

If you suppress the headings in your output and save your print criteria in a PRINT template, you are asked:

<span id="_Toc204225775" class="anchor"></span>Figure 34: Print—Confirming the Suppression of Headings in a PRINT Template

DO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SUPPRESS SUBHEADERS WHEN PRINTING TEMPLATE?

Subheaders are the names of SORT BY fields you see in the body of your report, when you do *not* include those SORT BY fields as print fields. To automatically suppress all subheaders, answer YES at this prompt.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/039.png) NOTE: When you are sorting, you can suppress subheaders individually at each sort level by entering an at-sign (@) in front of the field on which you are sorting.  
  
REF: For more information, see the “<u>Sorting</u>” section.

#### Custom Headings and Footers

You can print complex, multi-line headings by using a PRINT template to hold your heading format. For example, suppose that you want the patient’s name and date of birth to appear as the heading at every page break. You could first create a PATIENT HEADER template, as shown in <u>Figure 35</u>:

<span id="_Ref155591893" class="anchor"></span>Figure 35: Print—Creating a PRINT Template with a Custom Header

SORT BY: <span class="mark">NAME</span>

START WITH NAME: FIRST// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

FIRST PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">“PATIENT NAME: ”</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">NAME</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">“DATE OF BIRTH: ”;C50</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">DATE OF BIRTH</span>

THEN PRINT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: <span class="mark">PATIENT HEADER</span>

Are you adding ‘PATIENT HEADER’ as a new PRINT TEMPLATE? No// <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

DEVICE:

Then, later, when you do another print, at the heading prompt, enter the template name, as shown in <u>Figure 36</u>:

<span id="_Ref155591928" class="anchor"></span>Figure 36: Print—Selecting an Existing PRINT Template with a Custom Header

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <span class="mark">\[PATIENT HEADER\]</span>

When you enter a PRINT template name such as PATIENT HEADER at the “Heading (S/C):...” prompt, the format of the template is used as a replacement for the full normal report heading on each page of your report. It replaces the full default heading, including:

- Title
- Time
- Date
- Page number
- Field names
- Separator line

Thus, the header, as defined above, would contain *no* column headings and would *not* be separated from the body of the report by a horizontal line or even a blank line. You can add these in yourself as print fields in the template, if you desire.

#### Custom Footers

You can also add custom footers to the bottom of each page of a report. First, save the contents of the footer in a template as you do to create a custom heading. Then, use the template at the “HEADING:” prompt with a dash (-) before the first square bracket, as shown in <u>Figure 37</u>Figure 37:

<span id="_Ref523996613" class="anchor"></span>Figure 37: Print—Including a Custom Footer in a PRINT Template

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <span class="mark">-\[PATIENT FOOTER\]</span>

You can specify both a heading and footer like <u>Figure 38</u>:

<span id="_Ref155591981" class="anchor"></span>Figure 38: Print—Including a Custom Header and Footer in a PRINT Template

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// <span class="mark">\[PATIENT HEADER\]-\[PATIENT FOOTER\]</span>

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/040.png) NOTE: Specifying only a footer at the “Heading (S/C):” prompt suppresses the default heading. If you need a header as well as footer, you *must* use custom templates for both.

#### Printing Sort Criteria in the Heading or the Footer

You can print the sort criteria (values used to sort the report) in the header in two different ways:

- At the “Heading (S/C):” prompt, entering C prints the sort criteria in the automatically generated report heading.
- Use the [sort qualifier](#sort-qualifier-reference) ;P*a*-*b* to save the FROM and TO values used to sort a report. Then, in a customized header or footer (stored in SORT templates), you can retrieve the sort values with PARAM(“*a-string*”).

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/041.png) REF: For more information, see the description of the [;Pa-b](#pa-b) sort qualifier.

# Search

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you print reports, you can print a subset of the total number of file entries, if you sort your output. For example, by sorting on a file’s DATE field, you could sort for entries from October 1<sup>st</sup> to October 15<sup>th</sup>, and only print entries whose DATE field falls in that sort range.

Selecting a subset of entries by sorting works well if the subset of entries you would like to print can be isolated based on a contiguous sort range. However, what if you would like a different set of entries (e.g., only entries whose DATE field is equal to September 1<sup>st</sup>, October 1<sup>st</sup>, or November 1<sup>st</sup>)? You *cannot* do this with a sort range, because the sort range that includes September 1<sup>st</sup> and November 1<sup>st</sup> would include every entry between the two dates.

When you use VA FileMan’s search capabilities, you have much more control over what entries you select from a file for printing.

## How to Search

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

As with VA FileMan’s print capabilities, there are two methods in which you can use VA FileMan’s search features:

- An option that has been set up already to allow you to search a particular file.
- VA FileMan’s Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] option, which lets you perform a search on any file to which you have access.

In either case, use of VA FileMan’s search features is very similar. In most cases, the only difference is that with the Search File Entries \[DISEARCH\] option, you have to choose which file to search.

The steps in searching are:

1.  Enter the search conditions (truth tests) to perform on each entry.
7.  Specify how the search conditions should be combined (link them together with logical ANDs & ORs) to select records.
8.  Format your output (i.e., choose the sort order and print fields).

## Search Steps

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Enter Conditions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

First, you *must* enter one or more search conditions to test each entry. For each condition you choose a field in the entry and a condition to compare the field against.

For example, you could check if an entry’s DATE field is NULL, GREATER THAN 10/1/96, or EQUALS 10/1/96.

#### Search Condition Tests

<u>Table 4</u> lists the six possible search conditions against which you can test entries. It also includes:

- The symbol that represents the condition (if any).
- For what field types the condition can be used.
- The description/arguments of each condition.

</table>

<span id="_Ref345508725" class="anchor"></span>Table 5: Search—Condition Operators

When you start your search, VA FileMan asks you to enter a:

1.  Field.
9.  Condition.
10. Value to which the field is compared.

For example, to create a search condition that would find all entries whose DATE ACCESS CODE LAST CHANGED field contains a date older than 120 days in the past, you would enter the following, as shown in <u>Figure 39</u>:

<span id="_Ref155592166" class="anchor"></span>Figure 39: Search—Example of a Search Condition

-A- SEARCH FOR FIELD: <span class="mark">DATE ACCESS CODE LAST CHANGED</span>

-A- CONDITION: <span class="mark">LESS THAN</span>

-A- GREATER THAN: <span class="mark">T-120 \<Enter\></span> (Jun 20, 1995)

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/042.png) NOTE: Each prompt in <u>Figure 39</u> begins with “-A-”; what you have entered becomes search condition A.

Once you enter your first search condition, you can enter additional search conditions, if you wish. VA FileMan assigns the letter A to the first search condition, B to the second search condition (if any), C to the third, and so on.

<u>Figure 40</u> is an example of entering two truth tests:

<span id="_Ref524016018" class="anchor"></span>Figure 40: Search—Example of Two Truth Tests

-A- SEARCH FOR FIELD: <span class="mark">DATE ACCESS CODE LAST CHANGED</span>

-A- CONDITION: <span class="mark">LESS THAN</span>

-A- GREATER THAN: <span class="mark">T-120 \<Enter\></span> (Jun 20, 1995)

-B- SEARCH FOR FIELD: <span class="mark">ACCESS CODE</span>

-B- CONDITION: <span class="mark">‘NULL</span>

-C- SEARCH FOR FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

### Combine Conditions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

After defining a series of conditions (A, B, etc.), you combine the conditions to yield the complete test that an entry *must* satisfy to be selected in the search. The complete test is a logical combination of tests A, B, etc., using AND, OR, and NOT.

#### Operators for Combining Search Conditions

<u>Table 5</u> lists the possible operators to combine search conditions:

<table>
<caption><p><span id="_Ref345509562" class="anchor"></span>Table 6: Browser—Navigation Keystrokes</p></caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 18%" />

<td>For truth test to be <strong>true</strong>, the conditions on both sides of the <strong>AND</strong> operator <em>must</em> be <strong>true</strong>. The <strong>&amp;</strong> symbol can be omitted (i.e., <strong>AB</strong> is the same as <strong>A&amp;B</strong>).</td>
<td><strong>A&amp;B</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>NOT</strong></td>
<td><strong>‘</strong> or <strong>-</strong></td>
<td>For truth test to be <strong>true</strong>, the condition following <strong>NOT</strong> (i.e., single quote <strong>‘</strong> or dash <strong>-</strong>) <em>must</em> be <strong>false</strong>. If <strong>A</strong> is <strong>false</strong>, <strong>‘A</strong> evaluates to <strong>true</strong>.</td>
<td><strong>‘A</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>OR</strong></td>
<td>Enter on new line.</td>
<td>For truth test to be <strong>true</strong>, only one of the conditions that are combined with <strong>OR</strong> needs to be <strong>true</strong>. If <strong>A</strong> is <strong>true</strong> and <strong>B</strong> is <strong>false</strong>, <strong>A OR B</strong> evaluates to <strong>true</strong>.</td>
<td><p>IF: <strong>A &lt;Enter&gt;</strong></p>
<p>OR: <strong>B &lt;Enter&gt;</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<span id="_Ref345509562" class="anchor"></span>Table 6: Browser—Navigation Keystrokes

For example, if you just want to find all entries for which search condition A is true, you enter the following, as shown in <u>Figure 41</u>:

<span id="_Ref155592392" class="anchor"></span>Figure 41: Search—Example of a Single Search Condition Using a Truth Test

-B- SEARCH FOR FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

IF: <span class="mark">A</span>

OR: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

A more complicated search might have a number of search conditions (e.g., A, B, C, and D). Thus, for example, to find all entries which do either of the following:

- Satisfy both truth tests A and B.
- Do *not* satisfy truth test C, but satisfy truth test D.

You could combine search conditions, as shown in <u>Figure 42</u>:

<span id="_Ref524016944" class="anchor"></span>Figure 42: Search—Example of a Multiple Search Condition Using Truth Tests

-E- SEARCH FOR FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

IF: <span class="mark">A&B</span>

OR: <span class="mark">‘C&D</span>

OR: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

In the example above, the logic says: “if A and B, or if *not*C (but D)”.

### Format Output

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The remaining steps to finish your search are to choose your sorting criteria (same as with printing) and to choose the fields to print for each matched entry (also the same as with the printing).

A complete search (entering search conditions, combining search conditions, and finishing the search) is shown in <u>Figure 43</u>:

## Details and Features

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Sorting and Searching

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

As you recall from the “<u>Print</u>” section, you can print a subset of entries from a file by sorting (i.e., printing only those entries that fall between a sort-from value and a sort-to value). Searches also select a subset of entries from a file, although with more flexibility than with sorting.

When you print your output from a search, you are also given a chance to sort the output. This means that while searching selects a subset of entries to print, through sorting you can further restrict that subset of entries that is going to print. How does sorting affect the output of the searches?

The answer is that VA FileMan uses *both* your search and sort order to select entries. You enter the search criteria *before* you enter the sort order. However, the selection of entries indicated in the sort (“START WITH … GO TO” dialog) sorting is done first, after which the search conditions are applied to all remaining entries to determine the final set of matching entries.

### SEARCH Templates

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can save the results of your search in a SEARCH template. Doing this allows you to:

- Reuse your search criteria to perform another search.
- Reuse your search results (the list of entries selected as a result of both the search and the sort order).

This is because SEARCH templates store both your search criteria and the list of entries that is found in your search. SEARCH templates are stored in the SORT TEMPLATE (#.401) file.

#### Creating SEARCH Templates

The place to save your search criteria and results in a SEARCH template is right after you specify your search conditions. At this point, you are prompted:

<span id="_Toc204225785" class="anchor"></span>Figure 44: Search—Creating a SEARCH Template

STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE:

You can create a template at this prompt. Because SEARCH templates are stored in the same file as SORT templates (SORT TEMPLATE \[#.401\]), you *cannot* give a SEARCH template the same name as a SORT template. To avoid creating a SEARCH template, just press the Enter key at this prompt. Usually, only the creator of a SEARCH template can use it.

#### Reusing Search Criteria Stored in a SEARCH Template

Whenever you do a search, you can reuse the search criteria (i.e., your combined search conditions) stored in a SEARCH template. To do this, enter the bracketed SEARCH template name at the first “SEARCH FOR FIELD:” prompt:

<span id="_Toc204225786" class="anchor"></span>Figure 45: Search—Reusing a SEARCH Template at the “SEARCH FOR FIELD” Prompt

-A- SEARCH FOR FIELD: <span class="mark">\[RESEARCH 1\]</span>

A new search is performed with the recalled search criteria.

#### Reusing Search Results in another Search

Whenever you do a search, you can recall the results of a previous search (the list of entries found in the search) at the “SORT BY:” prompt. In this case, the new search is done against the entries in the SEARCH template, rather than the entire file. Answer the “SORT BY:” prompt with the bracketed SEARCH template name:

<span id="_Toc204225787" class="anchor"></span>Figure 46: Search—Reusing a SEARCH Template at the “SORT BY” Prompt

SORT BY: NAME// <span class="mark">\[RESEARCH 1\]</span>

#### Reusing Search Results in a Print

When doing VA FileMan prints, you can also recall the results of a previous search at the “SORT BY:” prompt. In this case, the entries saved in the SEARCH template are the ones printed in the report. This is handy if you do a search, collect a group of entries, and then want to print several different reports based on the same set of entries.

### Internal vs. External Field Values for Search Conditions

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following are search conditions for specific DATA TYPE fields:

- SET OF CODES—You *must* use external values for the search conditions.
- DATE/TIME and COMPUTED (that evaluate to DATE/TIME)—You can enter internal or external values for the search conditions.
- NUMERIC, COMPUTED (that do *not* evaluate to DATE/TIME), and FREE TEXT—There is no difference between internal and external value.
- POINTER TO A FILE or VARIABLE-POINTER—The sort is based on the field type of the .01 field of the pointed-to file.

### Print Number of Matches Found

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you only want to print the number of matches found, *without* printing any of the matched entries, answer the “FIRST PRINT FIELD:” prompt by simply pressing the Enter key.

### Searching Multiples

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Searching on Multiple-valued fields, like the DIAGNOSIS field in the PATIENT (#2) file, is a special situation. You *must* specify whether a truth test is to be considered met if *at least one* of the subentries for an entry passes the test or if *all* the subentries *must* pass the test.

When truth tests contain a negative (contains a single quote), you can even specify that an entry with *no* subentries should automatically pass the test.

For example, suppose that you want to search for all patients who were born before 1920 and who *do not* have a DIAGNOSIS containing the word ANGINA, as shown in <u>Figure 47</u>:

<span id="_Ref155622284" class="anchor"></span>Figure 47: Search—Dialog of a Search on a Multiple Field: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select VA FileMan Option: <span class="mark">SEARCH \<Enter\></span> File Entries

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: PATIENT// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

-B- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: <span class="mark">SERVICE CONNECTED</span>

1 <span class="mark">SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS (multiple)</span>

2 SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE

3 SERVICE CONNECTED?

CHOOSE 1-3: <span class="mark">1 \<Enter\></span> SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS (multiple)

-B- CONTAINS: <span class="mark">ANGINA</span>

-C- SEARCH FOR PATIENT SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS SUB-FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

-C- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

IF: <span class="mark">A&’B \<Enter\></span> DATE OF BIRTH LESS THAN 1920 (1920)

and not PATIENT SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS CONTAINS (case-insensitive) “ANGINA”

DO YOU WANT THIS SEARCH SPECIFICATION TO BE CONSIDERED TRUE FOR CONDITION -B-

1\) WHEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE ‘SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS’ MULTIPLES SATISFIES IT

2\) WHEN ALL OF THE ‘SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS’ MULTIPLES SATISFY IT

3\) WHEN ALL OF THE ‘SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS’ MULTIPLES SATISFY IT,

OR WHEN THERE ARE NO ‘SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS’ MULTIPLES

CHOOSE 1-3: 1// <span class="mark">3</span>

OR:

STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE:

For this example (<u>Figure 47</u>), choosing the following number means:

- 1 = Find people born before 1920 who have *at least one* SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITION that does *not* contain “ANGINA.”
- 2 = Find people born before 1920 who have *at least one* SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITION and *none* containing “ANGINA.”
- 3 = Find people born before 1920 who either have no SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITION at all or whose SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONs do *not* contain “ANGINA.”

Another ambiguity about searches of multiple fields is how to interpret two separate truth tests on the same subfield.

For example, if you are searching for DIAGNOSIS containing ANGINA and also for DIAGNOSIS containing PECTORIS, do you want to find:

- Only those patients who have ANGINA *and*PECTORIS in the *same* diagnosis name?
- Patients who might have one diagnosis containing ANGINA and a *different* diagnosis containing PECTORIS?

Whenever you combine two truth tests (e.g., A and B) pertaining to the same Multiple-valued field, you are prompted with the following (<u>Figure 48</u>):

<span id="_Ref446319586" class="anchor"></span>Figure 48: Search—Prompts Encountered when Searching on a Multiple Field

CONDITION -A- WILL APPLY TO THE SAME MULTIPLE AS CONDITION -B-

OK? YES//

In this example (<u>Figure 47</u> and <u>Figure 48</u>), a YES answer means that ANGINA and PECTORIS *must* be found in the *same* DIAGNOSIS. If you answer NO, you can specify how A and B apply, as shown in <u>Figure 49</u>:<span id="_Hlt446381562" class="anchor"></span>

Figure 49: Search—Additional Prompts Encountered when Searching on a Multiple Field

DO YOU WANT THIS SEARCH SPECIFICATION TO BE CONSIDERED TRUE FOR CONDITION -A-

1\) WHEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE ‘DIAGNOSIS’ MULTIPLES SATISFIES IT

2\) WHEN ALL OF THE ‘DIAGNOSIS’ MULTIPLES SATISFY IT

CHOOSE 1-2: 1// <span class="mark">2</span>

DO YOU WANT THIS SEARCH SPECIFICATION TO BE CONSIDERED TRUE FOR CONDITION -B-

1\) WHEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE ‘DIAGNOSIS’ MULTIPLES SATISFIES IT

2\) WHEN ALL OF THE ‘DIAGNOSIS’ MULTIPLES SATISFY IT

CHOOSE 1-2: 1// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

In this case (<u>Figure 49</u>), all the diagnoses would need to satisfy the A condition, but only one (or more) would need to satisfy the B condition.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/043.png) NOTE: Applying search tests to fields in a Multiple selects entries at the top-level of the file. VA FileMan’s searching features *cannot* be used to select specific subentries.

# Browser

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If your site is using Kernel, your site manager may have set up an output device called BROWSER. If so, you can view any report *on the screen* instead of *on paper*. Do this by printing your report to the BROWSER device instead of the HOME device or a printer.

The Browser makes it very easy to view reports on screen. Its main features are:

- Scroll forwards *and backwards* through a report. This means you do *not* lose reports “off the top” of the screen, like you do when you print to the HOME device.
- Use the Search feature to find and immediately jump to any text in a report.
- Copy text from the report to the VA FileMan clipboard; later, if you are editing a mail message or other WORD-PROCESSING-type field with the Screen Editor, you can paste from the clipboard.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/044.png) REF: For more information on the Screen Editor, see the “<u>Screen Editor</u>” section.

As you become accustomed to using the BROWSER device, you may find that you start to save paper by viewing reports that otherwise you would end up printing.

The [Browser \[DDBROWSER\]](#browser-as-an-option) option lets you browse the contents of any WORD-PROCESSING-type field to which you have access.

# VA FileMan Prompts

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Many VA VistA application packages have a *Scrolling Mode* interface. Scrolling Mode works as follows:

1.  Computer puts a prompt on the screen.
11. User enters a response to the prompt.
12. Computer places another prompt on the screen, scrolling down one line. Previous prompts move up and eventually off of the screen.

In Scrolling Mode, prompting occurs in the same predetermined order, in a sequence designed by the application developer. You enter a value and the computer stores your responses one at a time. And, unless you are familiar with a few timesaving scrolling mode techniques, you have to step through each prompt in a record before you can finish editing the record.

Recently developed VistA applications often use a *screen-oriented* interface (i.e., Screen Mode) for editing data. However, scrolling mode interfaces are still used quite heavily in VistA applications.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/047.png) REF: For more information on Screen Mode, see the “<u>ScreenMan</u>” section.

After reading about a few of the Scrolling Mode operations discussed in this section, you should be able to enter and edit data in Scrolling Mode with a minimum number of keystrokes.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/048.png) NOTE: VA FileMan is in the process of converting all *non*-developer dialogs to use VA FileMan (FM) dialogs framework, so that translations can be table-driven.

<span id="_Hlt446148108" class="anchor"></span>

## The \<Enter\> Key

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To enter data in scrolling mode, you primarily enter data or commands at a prompt on your terminal screen. After typing a command or data at your terminal keyboard, you *must* send your response from your terminal to the computer. Pressing the Enter key on your keyboard (abbreviated as \<Enter\> in examples) sends all typed input to the computer for action or storage.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/049.png) NOTE: Some older documentation examples still refer to it as the Return key (shown as \<RET\> in examples).

If you type a response but fail to press the Enter key, the computer waits; it does *not* do anything until you indicate that you have finished entering your response. Pressing the Enter key also indicates to the computer when you have decided to “enter” nothing at all. Whenever you press the Enter key without first entering data or a command, you indicate to the computer either to avoid acting or to take the default action at the current prompt. The computer then moves on to the next prompt.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/050.png) NOTE: Some prompts require a user response; so, if you only press the Enter key *without* a valid response, the system continues to repeat the prompt until you respond with a valid value.

## Standard Prompt Structure

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The standard VA FileMan prompt consists of three parts, as shown in <u>Figure 51</u>:

<span id="_Ref155595450" class="anchor"></span>Figure 51: VA FileMan Prompts—Sample Component Parts of a Prompt

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/051.png)

## Responding to Prompts

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When VA FileMan prompts you for a response, typically, a colon (:) is used at the end of the prompt; the computer waits for a response. Prompts are often asking for the value of a field in a file, like the one shown in <u>Figure 52</u>:

<span id="_Ref523837130" class="anchor"></span>Figure 52: VA FileMan Prompts—Asking for a Response

DATE OF BIRTH:

This type of prompt is waiting for you to enter a value (e.g., 3 OCT 49). Do *not* forget to press the Enter key ([\<Enter\>](#_Hlt446148108)) to complete your interaction.

If the answer to the prompt question is a choice of several things, the prompt often starts with the word “Select”, as shown in <u>Figure 53</u>:

<span id="_Ref523837145" class="anchor"></span>Figure 53: VA FileMan Prompts—“Select-type” Prompts, Offering a Choice

Select PATIENT NAME:

If the question requires either a YES or NO response (in which case simply entering Y or N, upper- or lowercase, is acceptable), the prompt can end with a question mark, rather than by a colon, as shown in <u>Figure 54</u>:

<span id="_Ref523837169" class="anchor"></span>Figure 54: VA FileMan Prompts—“Yes/No-type” Prompts

ARE YOU SURE?

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/052.png) REF: For more information on the specific types of fields (DATE/TIME, NUMERIC, WORD-PROCESSING, FREE TEXT, etc.) and how to edit them, see the “<u>Field Types</u>” section.

## Getting Online Help at Any Prompt (Enter ? or ??)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you are *not* sure how to answer a prompt, help is always available. Just enter one question mark (?) to get brief help, or two question marks (??) to get more detailed online help:

| Help Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ?      | Entering one question mark at a prompt gets a single line of help.                                                                                                                                     |
| ??     | Entering two question marks at a prompt gets more detailed help: a description of what values are acceptable, and/or a list of choices appropriate to the prompt where you entered the question marks. |

<span id="_Ref345582973" class="anchor"></span>Table 12: VA FileMan Prompts—“Replace” Prompt Shortcuts

## Incorrect Responses

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan checks each answer to a prompt immediately after you enter it. If you answer a prompt incorrectly, VA FileMan “beeps,” and displays two spaces and two question marks. It may also explain what was incorrect. Then, you can respond to the prompt again.

## Partial Responses

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you are choosing one of a set of responses, you can save keystrokes by *not* typing the full response. Type in only the first letter of first few letters representing the response that you desire. If the characters you enter uniquely identify one of the possible acceptable responses, VA FileMan “echoes back” the remaining characters and uses the matching choice as your response.

If more than one possible answer begins with the characters that you typed, VA FileMan displays the possible choices in a list, and asks you to choose which choice you want by number, as shown in <u>Figure 55</u>:

<span id="_Ref345588389" class="anchor"></span>Figure 55: VA FileMan Prompts—Dialog to Choose from a List in VA FileMan: Sample User Entries at Prompts

CHOOSE 1-3: <span class="mark">1 \<Enter\></span> ScreenMan

## Default Responses

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When working in VistA applications, the computer frequently presents a *default* answer along with a prompt. This answer is built into the application program and represents the most probable response to the prompt that is being asked. These default answers are clearly identified by the double slash marks that follow them (//). If the default answer that is provided is correct, you need only press the Enter key to accept it.

For example:

<span id="_Ref155595697" class="anchor"></span>Figure 56: VA FileMan Prompts—Prompts with Default Responses

SSN: <span class="mark">000123124</span>//

In this case (<u>Figure 56</u>), if you press the Enter key, 000123124 is posted as your response to this prompt.

If, on the other hand, the default answer is *not* what you need, enter the correct information at the prompt. For example:

<span id="_Toc204225798" class="anchor"></span>Figure 57: VA FileMan Prompts—Overriding the Default Response to a Prompt

SSN: <span class="mark">000123124</span>// <span class="mark">000234563 \<Enter\></span>

When editing data stored in fields, defaults are used to present the current value of the field. As with any default prompt, if you just press the Enter key, the current value of the field is left unchanged. To change the value of the field, enter a new value and press the Enter key.

## Longer Default Responses and the “Replace…With” Editor

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When a default is 20 or more characters in length, it is *not* followed by double slashes (//). Instead, it is presented with a “Replace” prompt:

<span id="_Toc204225799" class="anchor"></span>Figure 58: VA FileMan Prompts—Long Responses Employing the “Replace...With” Editor

ADDRESS 1: 1 Main Street Replace

The “Replace” prompt employs the “Replace...With” Editor. At the “Replace” prompt, you can revise some or all of the existing default answer. To revise only a piece of the existing default response, type in any series of letters that are part of the existing default answer that you want to change and then press the Enter key. At the “With” prompt, enter the series of characters to replace the original series, and press the Enter key. At this point, the “Replace” prompt is presented again, so that you can enter additional corrections. If you are all done, however, just press the Enter key to finish working in the field and move on to the next prompt.

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225800" class="anchor"></span>Figure 59: VA FileMan Prompts—Changing a Long Response Using the “Replace...With” Editor

ADDRESS 1: 1 Main Street Replace <span class="mark">Main \<Enter\></span> With <span class="mark">North \<Enter\></span>

Replace <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

1 North Street

ADDRESS 2:

To replace the entire default answer at a “Replace...With” prompt, simply enter three periods (…), called an ellipsis, at the “Replace” prompt. You are then able to replace the entire default with what you enter at the “With” prompt:

<span id="_Toc204225801" class="anchor"></span>Figure 60: VA FileMan Prompts—Replacing an Entire Entry Using the Ellipsis (...)

ADDRESS 1: 1 Main Street Replace <span class="mark">... \<Enter\></span> With <span class="mark">1 North Street \<Enter\></span>

Replace <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

1 North Street

ADDRESS 2:

If you want to delete the entire text, enter the at-sign (@) at the “Replace” prompt:

<span id="_Toc204225802" class="anchor"></span>Figure 61: VA FileMan Prompts—Deleting an Entire Entry Using the At-Sign (@)

ADDRESS 1: 1 Main Street Replace <span class="mark">@ \<Enter\></span>

SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

ADDRESS 2:

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/053.png) NOTE: The at-sign (@) is the command in many places to signal deletion.

### “Replace...” Prompt Shortcuts

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Table 12</u> lists shortcut responses when entering data at the “Replace” prompt:

| Shortcut           | Action                                                                               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ...            | Replaces everything.                                                                 |
| xxx...         | Replaces everything starting from the characters *xxx* to the end.               |
| ...xxx         | Replaces everything from the beginning up to and including the characters *xxx*. |
| xxx...yyy      | Replaces everything starting from *xxx* up to and including *yyy*.           |
| end or END | Appends what you enter at the “With” prompt to the end of the value.                 |

<span id="_Ref345582987" class="anchor"></span>Table 13: Field Types—Abbreviations for Dates

## Prompts with a List of Choices

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If the acceptable answer to a field prompt is one of a set of choices, you can display the list of choices by entering one or two question marks. If that set of choices is short enough to be displayed on five or six lines, the choices are listed when you enter one question mark.

<u>Figure 62</u> is an example:

<span id="_Ref155277676" class="anchor"></span>Figure 62: VA FileMan Prompts—Displaying a List of Choices

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">?</span>

ANSWER WITH PATIENT NAME

CHOOSE FROM:

FMPATIENT,SEVEN

FMPATIENT,EIGHTEEN

FMPATIENT,NINETEEN

Answer must be 3-30 characters in length.

Select PATIENT NAME:

When you enter one question mark (?) and the entry list is long, you are asked if you want to see all the entries. Besides a YES or NO response, you can enter a caret (^) followed by a string of characters to see a list of all entries beginning with the one that starts with those characters.

<u>Figure 63</u> shows selection of an entry starting with an alpha character:

<span id="_Ref389661492" class="anchor"></span>Figure 63: VA FileMan Prompts—Displaying a Subset of Choices from a List

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">? \<Enter\></span>

ANSWER WITH PATIENT NAME, OR SSN

DO YOU WANT THE ENTIRE 1890-ENTRY PATIENT LIST? <span class="mark">^</span>F <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

CHOOSE FROM:

FMPATIENT,20

FMPATIENT,21

FMPATIENT,22

FMPATIENT,23

‘^’ TO STOP <span class="mark">^ \<Enter\></span>

YOU MAY ENTER A NEW PATIENT, IF YOU WISH

Enter patient name in “Last, First Middle” format \[3-30 characters\].

Select PATIENT NAME:

If you know the list is long and still want it to be displayed, you can enter two question marks (??) to force the display of the entire list.

## Key Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

During a data entry session, VA FileMan checks that the combination of fields that make up a key for a record is unique for all records in the file. If a single field makes up a key, VA FileMan checks for uniqueness as soon as that field is edited. If more than one field makes up a key (i.e., compound key), VA FileMan checks that the combination of new key field values is unique only at the end of the data entry session (unless otherwise instructed in the software code by the developer). If a compound key is *not* unique, VA FileMan restores the fields that make up the key to their pre-edited values and prints a message.

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225805" class="anchor"></span>Figure 64: VA FileMan Prompts—Entering a Duplicate Compound Key

Select ZZTEST NAME: <span class="mark">\`16 \<Enter\></span> FMPATIENT,THREE 9900 SEP 03, 1932

ID NUMBER: 9900// <span class="mark">9800</span>

DATE: SEP 3,1932// <span class="mark">1/21/1932 \<Enter\></span> (JAN 21, 1932)

\*\*\*\*\* NOTE \*\*\*\*\*

Some of the previous edits are not valid because they create one or more

duplicate keys. Some fields have been restored to their pre-edited

values.

Do you want to see a list of those fields? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

The following field(s) have been restored to their pre-edited values:

File: ZZTEST File (#16999)

Key: A

Record: ‘FMPATIENT,THREE’ (#16)

Field: ID NUMBER(#1)

Invalid value: 9800

Restored to: 9900

Field: DATE (#2)

Invalid value: JAN 21, 1932

Restored to: SEP 03, 1932

## Special Responses to Field Prompts

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Deleting a Field’s Value (@)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you want to delete an answer previously entered, without substituting any other answer, enter an at-sign (@) as a response to that prompt, as shown in <u>Figure 65</u>:

<span id="_Ref155277752" class="anchor"></span>Figure 65: VA FileMan Prompts—Deleting a Field Entry

DATE OF BIRTH: May 21, 1946// <span class="mark">@ \<Enter\></span>

SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span>

In this example (<u>Figure 65</u>), the date on file would be erased: there is no answer to the DATE OF BIRTH question; its value is now NULL. You are asked to confirm the deletion; this gives you a chance to change your mind before deleting the field.

### Jumping to another Field with the Caret (^)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you fail to notice a typing error until after you pressed the Enter key and stored a field, you can still correct this error. What you need to do is go back to the field where the error occurred. You can usually accomplish this by using the *jump* command. This command requires entering a caret (^) along with the name, or first few letters, of the field to which you wish to jump. Instead of moving to the next prompt, you jump to the prompt you identified, as shown in <u>Figure 66</u>:

<span id="_Ref523839079" class="anchor"></span>Figure 66: VA FileMan Prompts—Using the Caret (^) Key to “Jump” to a Specific Field

SSN: 000123123// <span class="mark">^DATE OF BIRTH</span>

DATE OF BIRTH:

To get a list of the fields to which you can jump, enter a caret and a question mark (^?) at any field prompt.

You can use the caret to jump both forward and backward in a sequence of fields.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/054.png) TIP: Sometimes, you may only need to update one field in a record. You can jump directly to that field once you start to edit that record. This can save time; you do not need to go through every field and prompt that precedes the one you want!

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/055.png) NOTE: The caret (^) is sometimes referred to as the *up-arrow* in some legacy documentation.

### Exiting with the Single Caret (^)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To exit or opt out of answering any question or prompt, enter the caret (^) by itself at the field prompt, as shown in <u>Figure 67</u>:

<span id="_Ref523840324" class="anchor"></span>Figure 67: VA FileMan Prompts—Using the Caret (^) Key to Exit a Prompt

SSN: 000123123// <span class="mark">^ \<Enter\></span>

Select PATIENT NAME:

In the previous example (<u>Figure 67</u>), the SSN field value 000123123 remains unchanged, but you skip the rest of the questions for this record and return to the “Select...” prompt. If you enter a caret (^) at the “Select...” prompt, you return to the previous prompt, and so on.

Entering the caret (^) by itself to exit a given function is a convention used throughout VistA applications.

### Exiting with the Double Caret (^^)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When the user is doing a lookup to the file, VA FileMan may search many indexes looking for a value that matches the users input. This can be time consuming. If the user wants to get out of the lookup before VA FileMan has completed the search, the user can enter two carets (^^) at any prompt.

### Mandatory (Required) Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In some cases a field is *mandatory*, and you *must* enter a value, if one is *not* already there; in other words, a NULL response (i.e., pressing the Enter key *without* making an entry) is *not* valid. When you use the caret (^) or press the Enter key *without* entering data in one or more fields in the entry, your terminal “beeps” and prompts you again to enter information.

If you do *not* fill in all required fields in a record, it is considered incomplete and is *not* stored unless you fill in the required fields. This protects the database from records containing so little information that they are useless. Enter the requested information.

If you still need to exit before you can provide all required information, you should abort your edit and start over later. You can usually exit out of the data editing sequence by answering any of the prompts with a caret (^).

### Spacebar Recall

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan can recall your most recent response to a prompt. This feature is called Spacebar Recall and employs the Spacebar and Enter keys. For example, if you are editing a particular patient in a Nursing application and then switch to the Order/Entry application to work with the same patient, you can usually retrieve the same patient by pressing the Spacebar *and*Enter keys (\<Spacebar\>\<Enter\>) at the second application’s (Order/Entry) “Select PATIENT NAME:” prompt.

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225809" class="anchor"></span>Figure 68: VA FileMan Prompts—Using the “Spacebar Recall” Functionality

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">\<Spacebar\>\<Enter\></span>

FMPATIENT,24

NAME: FMPATIENT,24//

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/056.png) TIP: You can use Spacebar Recall throughout VA FileMan and the Kernel. Experiment with this feature as a quick way to recall your last response to most prompts.

### Typical Data Entry Session

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Figure 69</u> is an example of a typical data entry session. This example is characteristic of editing data in many VistA applications:

<span id="_Ref490818078" class="anchor"></span>Figure 69: VA FileMan Prompts—Example of a Typical Data Entry Session

# Field Types

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Introduction

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This document describes several fundamental VA FileMan conventions, including:

- When the cursor comes to rest in a field, the computer expects you to respond.
- A field serves much the same purpose as a blank on a form.
- Each field has a prompt that identifies your response’s subject matter.
- You have several tools available to you at field prompts, including the:
- Caret (^) jump.
- Default response.
- “Replace...With” editor.
- Spacebar Recall (\<Spacebar\>\<Enter\>).
- At-sign (@) deletion.
- Some fields have additional restrictions, such as your response’s length or format. Enter one or two question marks (? or ??) to retrieve help on what is an acceptable entry for a particular field.

When you are editing a field, entering one question mark (?) at the field prompt usually provides enough help to infer what kind of field you have reached and to predict what kind of data is acceptable in this field (i.e., DATA TYPE field value).

You do *not* need to know a lot about these DATA TYPE field values, but a little information can be helpful. In the sections that follow, you will find examples and brief explanations about each field type (i.e., DATA TYPE field value). In VA FileMan, you will work with many, if not all, of the following DATA TYPE field values:

- [DATE/TIME](#datetime-fields)
- [NUMERIC](#numeric-fields)
- [SET OF CODES](#set-of-codes-fields)
- [FREE TEXT](#free)
- [WORD-PROCESSING](#word-processing-fields)
- [COMPUTED](#computed)
- [POINTER TO A FILE](#pointer)
- [VARIABLE-POINTER](#variable-pointer-fields)
- [BOOLEAN](#boolean-fields)
- [LABEL REFERENCE](#label-reference-fields)
- [TIME](#time-fields)
- [YEAR](#year-fields)
- [UNIVERSAL TIME](#universal-time-fields)
- [FT POINTER](#ft-pointer-fields)
- [FT DATE](#ft-date-fields)
- [RATIO](#ratio-fields)

In addition, [Subfiles (Multiples)](#subfiles-multiples) are introduced at the end of this section.

## DATE/TIME Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can use a variety of formats when entering dates. For example, a DATA TYPE field value of DATE/TIME would probably be used to hold a patient’s birthdate:

<span id="_Toc204225811" class="anchor"></span>Figure 70: Field Types—Entering a Date at a DATE/TIME Field

DATE OF BIRTH: MAR 3, 1955

With a DATE/TIME field type, as with all field types, entering a question mark retrieves help on acceptable responses. Enter one question mark (?) at a DATE/TIME field prompt and you are given help about what dates are acceptable for the particular field and what precision of date is needed (e.g., year, month, day, or time).

### Acceptable Formats for Entering Dates

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following are acceptable formats for entering dates:

- JULY 20, 1999 *or* July 20, 1999
- 7/20/99
- 20 JUL 99
- 10jul99
- 10 jul 99
- 072099

To simplify entering dates, you can use shortcuts such as:

- T for today
- T-1 for yesterday
- T+1 for tomorrow

You can also combine T with other shortcuts:

- D for day. For example, T-2D means two days ago.
- W for week. For example, T+1W means today plus one week.
- M for month. For example, T+4M means four months from today.

The year portion of the date can be left off. Normally, VA FileMan assumes the current year. Sometimes, you can input imprecise dates such as “JUL 99” or “1999”.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/059.png) NOTE: VA FileMan is Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant.

### Abbreviations for Dates

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Table 13</u> lists acceptable abbreviations when entering dates:

| Abbreviation                             | Meaning            |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| TODAY or Today or T or t | Today.             |
| TODAY+1 or T+1 or t+1        | Tomorrow.          |
| TODAY-7 or T-7 or t-7        | One week ago.      |
| TODAY+3W or T+3W or t+3w     | Three weeks hence. |

<span id="_Ref345583002" class="anchor"></span>Table 14: Field Types—Abbreviations for Times

### Times in DATE/TIME Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In some DATE/TIME fields, you can enter a time-of-day along with the date. For example, to indicate 4:00 PM on July 20, 1999, enter the date in one of the formats shown in Section <u>7.2.1</u>, “<u>Acceptable Formats for Entering Dates</u>,” followed by an at-sign (@), and then followed by the time.

For example, you might enter:

<span id="_Toc204225812" class="anchor"></span>Figure 71: Field Types—Entering a Date and Time

APPOINTMENT: 20 JUL 99@4PM

To be totally unambiguous, you can enter time in any of the following formats:

- Military time (four or six digits, no colon)
- hour AM/PM, hour:minute AM/PM
- hour:minute:second AM/PM

If you do omit an AM/PM notation, the following assumptions are made:

- If you enter one digit for the hour, a time between 6AM and 6PM is used. Thus, T@330 (or T@3:30) means today at 3:30 PM and T@945 (or T@9:45) means today at 9:45 AM.
- If you enter two digits for the hour, the actual hour entered is used (as if military time were being used). Thus, T@0330 (or T@03:30) means today at 3:30 AM.

As with dates, there are supported abbreviations you can use when entering times in DATE/TIME fields. For example:

- To enter the present moment, you can enter the word NOW.
- To enter an hour from the present moment, enter NOW+1H.
- To enter an hour ago from the present moment, enter NOW-1H.
- You can combine NOW with D for day and M for month and ‘ (apostrophe) for minute.
- You can enter MID for 12 a.m. and NOON for 12 p.m.

### Abbreviations for Times

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Table 14</u> lists acceptable abbreviations when entering time:

| Abbreviation | Meaning                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| NOW+3’   | Present time plus three minutes. |
| NOW+1H   | Present time plus one hour.      |
| NOW+3D   | Present time plus three days.    |
| NOW+4M   | Present time plus four months.   |
| NOON     | Today at 12:00 noon.             |
| MID      | Today at 24:00 midnight.         |

<span id="_Toc204225876" class="anchor"></span>Table 15: BOOLEAN Data Type Example

## NUMERIC Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

DATA TYPE field values of NUMERIC work very much like [FREE TEXT](#free) fields, except that input is restricted to valid numbers. There can also be restrictions as to how small or large a number is allowed, and how many decimal places are allowed. Entering one question mark retrieves help that tells you what responses are acceptable.

For example, a NUMERIC field type would probably be used to store the height of a patient:

<span id="_Toc204225813" class="anchor"></span>Figure 72: Field Types—Example of a NUMERIC Field

HEIGHT (cm): 196

## SET OF CODES Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

DATA TYPE field values of SET OF CODES (sometimes referred to as a SET) are preset to accept coded information. The codes are usually only one or two characters long. Each code in a SET represents a word or a series of words. For example, the codes Y and N often represent the words YES and NO. You can enter the code at this prompt instead of the entire word. If, however, you enter anything other than an acceptable code (or the word it represents), the computer rejects your response.

To see a list of acceptable codes, simply enter one question mark (?) in response to the prompt.

<u>Figure 73</u> shows how a SET OF CODES field type is used to store whether a patient is a smoker:

<span id="_Ref389661523" class="anchor"></span>Figure 73: Field Types—Example of a SET OF CODES Field

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,NINE</span>

SMOKER: <span class="mark">?</span>

Choose from:

S SMOKER

N NON-SMOKER

SMOKER: <span class="mark">N \<Enter\></span> NON-SMOKER

In the example in <u>Figure 73</u>, there were two choices for the user to select for the "SMOKER" field.

### Internal vs. External Values for SET OF CODES Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In <u>Figure 73</u>, the value of the SMOKER field is set to N, which is the code for NON-SMOKER. In this case:

- N—Internal value of the field (the form in which it is stored in the database).
- NON-SMOKER—External value of the field (the form in which it is displayed on screen and in reports).

Every DATA TYPE field value has an internal and external value; in most cases, however, the internal and external values are the same. SET OF CODES field types are an exception.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/060.png) NOTE: Probably, the only place you need to know the distinction between internal and external values is when you print a report and *sort* on a SET OF CODES-valued field. The sort order is based on the internal values (codes) if you sort on a SET OF CODES-valued field.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/061.png) REF: For more information on printing and sorting, see the “<u>Print</u>” section.

## FREE TEXT Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can enter almost any character from your keyboard in a DATA TYPE field value of FREE TEXT. The computer accepts numbers, letters, and most of the symbols that can be entered. The FREE TEXT field type places a restriction on the number of characters that you can enter. If you enter one question mark (?) in response to the prompt for a FREE TEXT-valued field, you learn how many characters you are allowed to enter.

For example, a FREE TEXT field type would probably be used to hold a patient’s street address:

<span id="_Toc204225815" class="anchor"></span>Figure 74: Field Types—Example of a FREE TEXT Field

ADDRESS: 123 Main Street

In some places, even though the field is FREE TEXT, checks are applied to make sure what is entered matches a certain format. For example, if you are entering a Social Security Number, which is stored as a DATA TYPE field value of FREE TEXT, *not*NUMERIC, your input would typically be checked to make sure it is nine characters in length and contains all digits:

<span id="_Toc204225816" class="anchor"></span>Figure 75: Field Types—Example of a FREE TEXT Field with Validation

SSN: <span class="mark">abcde \<Enter\></span> ??

ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH

SSN: <span class="mark">99999 \<Enter\></span> ??

ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH

SSN: <span class="mark">33233290 \<Enter\></span> ??

ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH

SSN: <span class="mark">000232343</span>

DATE:

## WORD-PROCESSING Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

DATA TYPE field values of WORD-PROCESSING can contain unlimited amounts of text data, and are suitable for things like mail messages, physician notes, and descriptions. Because of their special nature, VA FileMan provides special tools for entering and editing data into this kind of a field.

Two editors for editing WORD-PROCESSING field types are provided with VA FileMan (and described in their own section):

- <u>Screen Editor</u>
- <u>Line Editor</u>

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/062.png) REF: To set your default editor, see the “<u>Word-Processing Fields</u>” section. This section also explains how you can switch your current editor on-the-fly. For most people, the Screen Editor should be your Preferred Editor for WORD-PROCESSING fields.

When you encounter a WORD-PROCESSING field type, if your default editor is the Screen Editor, a portion of any existing text is displayed, and you are prompted “Edit? NO//”:

## COMPUTED Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

DATA TYPE field values of COMPUTED are typically used to output a value computed at run-time in a report. You *cannot* edit the value of a COMPUTED field type.

An example of a COMPUTED field type would be a field that calculated age based on today’s date and a patient’s DATE OF BIRTH field. Because the field is a COMPUTED field type, it can output a patient’s current age based on whatever today’s date is. You *cannot* edit the AGE field, but you can use it to print out the current age of the patient.

You are most likely to come across COMPUTED field types when printing with the CAPTIONED PRINT template. Choosing the CAPTIONED OUTPUT template automatically outputs all normal fields containing data for each entry in a report. However, you *must* choose whether you want COMPUTED fields included in the output as well, as shown in <u>Figure 78</u>:

<span id="_Ref345588399" class="anchor"></span>Figure 78: Field Types—Dialog to Choose a COMPUTED Field: Sample User Entries at Prompts

STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (Yes)

Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// <span class="mark">?</span>

Enter a code from the list.

Select one of the following:

N NO - No record number (IEN), no Computed Fields

Y Computed Fields

R Record Number (IEN)

B BOTH Computed Fields and Record Number (IEN)

At the "Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO//" prompt, you choose whether to output COMPUTED fields.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/065.png) REF: For more information on CAPTIONED OUTPUT, see the “<u>Inquire</u>” and “<u>Print</u>” sections.

## POINTER TO A FILE Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field value of POINTER TO A FILE is a field that directs the computer to another file for information. If you are working in the PATIENT (#2) file, for example, and you have reached a field that asks for the patient’s STATE, the field is probably a POINTER TO A FILE field that “points” to the STATE (#5) file. Because of pointers, such commonly used information as states can be stored in a single STATE (#5) file. Then, every file (e.g., PATIENT, VENDOR, INSURANCE, etc.) that needs to record a value for STATE can use a POINTER TO A FILE field to the STATE (#5) file to store that information.

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225820" class="anchor"></span>Figure 79: Field Types—Sample of a POINTER TO A FILE Field (1 of 2)

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/066.png)

<span id="_Toc204225821" class="anchor"></span>Figure 80. Field Types—Sample of a POINTER TO A FILE Field (2 of 2)

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: PATIENT// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (1890 entries)

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <span class="mark">STATE</span>

THEN EDIT FIELD: <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

Select PATIENT NAME: FMPATIENT,THREE

STATE: <span class="mark">??</span>

CHOOSE FROM:

ALABAMA

ALASKA

ARIZONA

.

.

.

STATE: <span class="mark">COLORADO</span>

Enter two question marks at the “STATE:” prompt to list available choices. If the choice you need is *not* listed, you can add that choice by typing it in (provided you have LAYGO access to add the entry). If the entry you enter is *not* matched, you are asked if you want to add a new entry. If you answer YES, VA FileMan adds the new entry. For example, if there was a state that did *not* have an entry in the STATE (#5) file, you could add it by entering it at the “STATE:” prompt.

## VARIABLE-POINTER Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A DATA TYPE field value of VARIABLE-POINTER is like the regular [POINTER TO A FILE](#pointer) field type, with one difference:

The VARIABLE-POINTER DATA TYPE can point to a single record in one of *several* files; whereas the regular POINTER TO A FILE DATA TYPE can point to a single record in only *one* file.

The PATIENT (#2) file, for example, might use a VARIABLE-POINTER field type to identify a provider; the provider might be a Staff Provider, stored in the (fictitious) PROVIDER file, or an outside provider, stored in another file.

For example, if you are working on a PATIENT (#2) file entry, and you need information that explains how to look up a name listed in one of several files. To get help, simply enter a single question mark (?) at the “PROVIDER” prompt. The system then displays instructions that explain how to choose a provider from either of the two files being pointed to, as shown in <u>Figure 81</u>.

<span id="_Ref345588409" class="anchor"></span>Figure 81: Field Types—Dialog Showing Help for Entries in a VARIABLE-POINTER Field: Sample User Entries at Prompts

PROVIDER: <span class="mark">?</span>

Enter one of the following:

S.EntryName to select a Staff Provider

O.EntryName to select an Outside Provider

To see the entries in any particular file, type \<Prefix.?\>

Entering one question mark at the “PROVIDER:” prompt displays online help that shows what prefixes are used to refer to entries in each pointed to file.

With VARIABLE-POINTER field types, you need to use a PREFIX in addition to an entry name to select an entry. In this example, the online help tells you that:

- To select a Staff Provider, prefix the provider’s name with “S.”.
- To select an Outside Provider, prefix the provider’s name with “O.”.

You can enter a PREFIX and one question mark to get a list of entries in a particular pointed-to file. For example, if you enter “S.?” you can get a list of all Staff Providers. Likewise, you can enter “S.FMPROVIDER” to get a list of all Staff Providers whose last names are FMPROVIDER. You can also enter “S.FMPROVIDER,ONE” to select a Staff Provider named One Fmprovider.

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225823" class="anchor"></span>Figure 82: Field Types—Using the PREFIX and a Question Mark to Get a List of Entries in a Pointed-To File

PROVIDER: <span class="mark">S.?</span>

CHOOSE FROM:

FMPROVIDER,ONE

FMPROVIDER,TWO

:

You can also select an entry in a VARIABLE-POINTER field by just entering a name *without* the PREFIX. In this case, VA FileMan searches each pointed-to file in succession until a match is found.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/067.png) NOTE: This method requires more processing time, since VA FileMan needs to search the various pointed-to files.

For example (<u>Figure 83</u>), to choose a provider *without* specifying in which file the provider can be found, enter the provider name only:

<span id="_Ref155278087" class="anchor"></span>Figure 83: Field Types—Searching for an Entry in a Pointed-To File

PROVIDER: <span class="mark">FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M</span>

Searching for a Staff Provider

Searching for a Outside Provider FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M

...OK? YES// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> (YES)

You can add an entry to one of the files that is being pointed to by a VARIABLE-POINTER field. To do this, enter the appropriate PREFIX and the new name to add at the field prompt.

For example, to add “FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M” as an Outside Provider (*not* a Staff Provider), use the appropriate PREFIX when adding the new entry (in this case, “O.”). When the requested name is *not* found, you are asked if you want to add the provider as a new entry. To add the entry, enter YES:

<span id="_Toc204225825" class="anchor"></span>Figure 84: Field Types—Adding a New Entry to a Pointed-To File

PROVIDER: <span class="mark">O.FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M.</span>

Are you adding ‘FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M.’ as a new OUTSIDE PROVIDER? No// <span class="mark">YES \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

OUTSIDE PROVIDER SEX: <span class="mark">MALE</span>

OUTSIDE PROVIDER DATE OF BIRTH: <span class="mark">020235 \<Enter\></span> (FEB 02, 1935)

OUTSIDE PROVIDER SSN: <span class="mark">000987321</span>

## Subfiles (Multiples)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Sometimes, a single field in a record is *not* enough to hold all the information required. For example, to keep track of the appointment history for a patient, a single field would *not* be enough. An ordinary field could only hold enough information to record a single appointment. But there needs to be a way to record as many appointments as a patient has had, which could range from none to several hundred. In addition, each appointment might have its own information that needs to be stored (e.g., date, time, location, doctor, etc.).

This situation is handled with what are known as Subfiles (also known as Multiples). Within an individual record, a Subfile (Multiple) can be used to hold this type of information:

<span id="_Ref491174811" class="anchor"></span>Figure 85: Field Types—Sample Subfile (Multiple) Field

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/068.png)

The fields in a Subfile (in this example \[<u>Figure 85</u>\], DATE, TIME, LOCATION, and DOCTOR) are called Subfields.

The word “Select” is always the first part of the prompt when you encounter a Multiple, to indicate that you are choosing among one of several possible values on file, as shown in <u>Figure 86</u>:

<span id="_Ref504485476" class="anchor"></span>Figure 86: Field Types—Example of a Multiple Field Prompt

<span class="mark">Select</span> APPOINTMENTS:

If, for a given Multiple, more than one entry has already been entered, the most recently created entry is displayed as a default. To see the list of entries already in the Multiple, enter two question marks (??) at the “Select...” prompt.

Because they are so useful, Subfiles (Multiples) are widely used throughout VistA. They are usually straightforward to use, because their structure as Subfiles mirrors the real-world structure of the information. For example, for a purchase order, the top-level record would be the purchase order. Because a single purchase order needs a place to store as few or as many items as are requested, the purchase order record has a Multiple to record the order items for the purchase order.

Subfiles can themselves contain Subfiles creating additional levels in files.

# Adding and Deleting Records

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## .01 Field

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The .01 field is the most important field in a file. For the records in a file, it usually identifies the record more than any other single field. For example, the .01 field of the PATIENT (#2) file is NAME. The .01 field of a WARD file might be WARD NAME.

Usually, in an edit dialog the .01 field is the field you are prompted for when you choose a record to edit. Typically, it is also the first field you edit once you have chosen the record.

The .01 field plays a role in both adding and deleting entries in a file:

- To *add* an entry to a file, you usually enter a new value at the .01 field’s prompt.
- To *delete* an entry to a file, you usually enter an at-sign (@) in the entry’s .01 field.

## How to Add a Record

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

As you recall from the “<u>Introduction</u>”, an entry is a complete record in a file. To add a new entry to a file, enter the name of the new entry at the “Select...” prompt where you ordinarily choose which record in the file to edit:

<span id="_Ref345588419" class="anchor"></span>Figure 87: Records—Dialog to Add a Record: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,ONE</span>

ARE YOU ADDING ‘FMPATIENT,ONE’ AS A NEW PATIENT (THE 121082ND)? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

This is the prompt for the record’s .01 field (see <u>Figure 87</u>). If you enter a name that does *not* exist in the file, you are prompted “Are you adding *‘XXXXXXXX*’ as a new ‘*ENTRY*’?”; where “*XXXXXXXX*” represents the field value and “ENTRY” represents the field or file name. If LAYGO is allowed and you answer YES to this prompt, VA FileMan adds the new entry to the file. You then go on to edit other fields for the new entry.

If a file has one or more data Keys defined (i.e., fields or combinations of fields that uniquely identify a record), then those fields *must* also be filled in before the new entry is added. There *must not* be any other records on the file that have the same values in all fields.

Finally, there may be a set of required fields (identifiers) for the new entry; these *must* be filled in with values for the new entry to be saved.

## Adding a Duplicate Record (Use Quotes)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

What if there is already a “FMPATIENT,ONE” in the PATIENT (#2) file, and you need to add a second entry with the same name “FMPATIENT,ONE”? Simply entering that name at the “Select...” prompt selects the existing entry. To create a *second*FMPATIENT,ONE entry, even though one with that name *already* exists, enter the entry name you want to add, but with *quotation marks* around it, as shown in <u>Figure 88</u>:

<span id="_Ref345588428" class="anchor"></span>Figure 88: Records—Dialog to Add a Duplicate Record: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">“FMPATIENT,ONE”</span>

ARE YOU ADDING ‘FMPATIENT,ONE’ AS A NEW PATIENT (THE 121082ND)? No// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (Yes)

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/069.png) REF: For instructions on adding entries with the same name to pointed-to files from a POINTER TO A FILE data type field, see the “[Adding Records at a POINTER TO A FILE Field](#adding-records-to-a-pointer-to-a-file-field)” section.

If a record has a data Key defined (i.e., fields or combinations of fields that uniquely identify a record), and if the data Key contains more than one field, then it would be possible to add a second FMPATIENT,ONE *without* using quotes. Suppose the Key fields were the NAME and the DATE OF BIRTH. Then the user would be prompted for both NAME and DATE OF BIRTH, and assuming that the DATE OF BIRTH of the second FMPATIENT,ONE were different from the existing record, VA FileMan would allow the user to add the new FMPATIENT,ONE *without* enclosing the name in quotes.

## How to Delete a Record

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To delete an existing record in a file, enter an at-sign (@) in the record’s .01 field. This tells VA FileMan to delete the record. In all deletions, you are asked to confirm the deletion before VA FileMan goes ahead and deletes the record. <u>Figure 89</u> is an example of deleting a record in a file:

<span id="_Ref345588440" class="anchor"></span>Figure 89: Records—Dialog to Delete a Record: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select DOCTOR NAME: <span class="mark">FMDOCTOR,TWO</span>

NAME: FMDOCTOR,TWO// <span class="mark">@</span>

ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE ‘FMDOCTOR,TWO” DOCTOR? <span class="mark">YES</span>

In this example (<u>Figure 89</u>), the user entered an at-sign (@) at the DOCTOR NAME (#.01) field to delete the entire entry for the FMDOCTOR,TWO.

## Repointing When Deleting Records

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

What if a record in another file points to the record you are deleting?

If you delete a record that is pointed to from another file, this leaves a dangling pointer that points to a *non*-existent entry. To prevent this, if the record you delete could be pointed to from another file, you are given the opportunity to either delete any pointers to the deleted record or change them all to point to another record.

For example, an entry in the PATIENT (#2) file may have a field that points to a doctor in the (fictitious) PROVIDER file. If you delete the doctor from the (fictitious) PROVIDER file, you should indicate what should happen to any entries in other files, including the PATIENT (#2) file that points to this doctor.

In the example in <u>Figure 90</u>, when you delete the FMDOCTOR,TWELVE record, you also re-points any entries that had been pointing to FMDOCTOR,TWELVE to point to FMDOCTOR,EIGHT.

<span id="_Ref345588452" class="anchor"></span>Figure 90: Records—Dialog to Delete a Record and Re-Point to a Different Record: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select DOCTOR NAME: <span class="mark">FMDOCTOR,TWELVE</span>

NAME: FMDOCTOR,TWELVE// <span class="mark">@</span>

ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE ‘FMDOCTOR,TWELVE” DOCTOR? <span class="mark">YES</span>

SINCE THE DELETED ENTRY MAY HAVE BEEN ‘POINTED TO’ BY ENTRIES IN THE ‘PATIENT’ FILE, ETC., DO YOU WANT THOSE POINTERS UPDATED (WHICH COULD TAKE QUITE A WHILE)? NO// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

WHICH DO YOU WANT TO DO?

1\) DELETE ALL SUCH POINTERS

2\) CHANGE ALL SUCH POINTERS TO POINT TO A DIFFERENT ‘DOCTOR’ ENTRY

CHOOSE 1) OR 2): <span class="mark">2</span>

THEN PLEASE INDICATE WHICH ENTRY SHOULD BE POINTED TO

Select DOCTOR NAME: <span class="mark">FMDOCTOR,EIGHT</span>

-OK? YES// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)

(RE-POINTING WILL OCCUR WHEN YOU LEAVE ENTER/EDIT OPTION)

When you leave the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option, the updating is done. A report is generated listing all changed entries; you need to specify on what device this report should be listed (<u>Figure 91</u>):

<span id="_Ref345588470" class="anchor"></span>Figure 91: Records—Dialog Showing a Report of Changed Entries: Sample Report

…EXCUSE ME, LET ME PUT YOU ON ‘HOLD’ FOR A SECOND...

DEVICE: HOME// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> SYSTEM

PATIENT ENTRIES WHOSE ‘ATTENDING PHYSICIAN’ POINTERS HAVE BEEN CHANGED

-———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-

FMPATIENT,TWENTY

FMPATIENT,ONE

FMPATIENT,ELEVEN

FMPATIENT,SEVEN

Select OPTION:

In this case (Figure 91), four entries were found that had FMDOCTOR,TWELVE as their doctor. Now that FMDOCTOR,TWELVE was deleted, these records are re-pointed to FMDOCTOR,EIGHT.

## Adding Records to a POINTER TO A FILE Field

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Suppose you are editing a POINTER TO A FILE-type field. This lets you choose an entry from another file to point to. If you have Learn-As-You-Go (LAYGO) access to the pointed-to file, you can also *add* new entries to it when editing the POINTER TO A FILE field.

For example, suppose you are editing the TITLE (#8) field in the NEW PERSON (#200) file, which is a POINTER TO A FILE type field that “points” to the TITLE (#3.1) file. What if you want to choose a TITLE that is *not* already in the TITLE (#3.1) file? You can add it as in the example shown in <u>Figure 92</u>:

<span id="_Ref345588479" class="anchor"></span>Figure 92: Records—Dialog to Add a New Entry to a Pointed-To File: Sample User Entries at Prompts

NAME: FMUSER,ONE// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

TITLE OCCUPATION CODE: <span class="mark">2210</span>

SSN: 000111659// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

.

.

.

In this example (<u>Figure 92</u>), after adding OIT STAFF as a new entry, if you go back to the TITLE field and enter two question marks (??) again and scroll through the list, OIT STAFF would be one of the choices listed for TITLE.

### Adding Duplicate-Named Entries

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can force an entry to be added to the pointed-to file, even if an entry with the same value already exists in the pointed-to file. To add a duplicate-named entry, surround the value to be added with one set of quotation marks, <u>Figure 93</u>:

<span id="_Ref523490331" class="anchor"></span>Figure 93: Records—Adding a Duplicate-Named Entry to a Pointed-To File

POINTER FIELD: <span class="mark">“FORCED NEW ENTRY”</span>

If the POINTER TO A FILE field that you are editing happens to be the NAME (#.01) field of the current file, you can add entries to both the current file and to the pointed-to file by surrounding your value with two sets of quotation marks as shown in <u>Figure 94</u>:

<span id="_Ref523490387" class="anchor"></span>Figure 94: Records—Adding an Entry to Both the Current File and to a Pointed-To File

POINTER FIELD (.01): <span class="mark">““FORCED NEW ENTRY””</span>

## Adding and Deleting from Multiples

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Some special considerations apply when you are editing Multiple-valued fields. One example of a Multiple field is the DIAGNOSIS field in the PATIENT (#2) file. As you recall from the “<u>Field Types</u>” section, a Multiple is a field in a record that can store multiple subrecords. In this case, VA FileMan *must* be able to store multiple diagnosis entries for a single patient, and it uses a Multiple field to do so:

<span id="_Ref345588487" class="anchor"></span>Figure 95: Records—Dialog Showing Entries to a Multiple Field: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select PATIENT NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,NINE</span>

Multiples have .01 fields, just like records at the top-level of a file. Thus, just as with records at the top-level of a file, you select entries in the Multiple at the Multiple’s “Select...” prompt. You can also add a new entry by typing it in at the Multiple’s “Select...” prompt. You can delete an entry in a Multiple by entering an at-sign (@) in the existing entry’s .01 field.

Enter one question mark (?) at a Multiple’s “Select...” prompt to retrieve brief help for the field; enter two question marks (??) to choose from the list of entries in the Multiple.

## Enter or Edit File Entries Option

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In most cases you enter and edit data through application programs. Applications are pre-programmed to allow you to edit specific files, and often only a subset of the fields in any given file. The application shields you from many aspects of editing the file data, such as even knowing the name of the file with which you are working. Usually, this information is already chosen for you by the application.

You can also edit data in a file directly, however, using VA FileMan’s Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option. Your ability to edit data in any given file depends on:

- Whether you have the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option on your menu.
- Whether you have access to edit the file in question.

The steps to use the Enter or Edit File Entries \[DIEDIT\] option are:

1.  At the “INPUT TO WHAT FILE:” prompt, choose which file to edit. To see what files you have access to, you can enter two question marks (??) at this prompt:

> <span id="_Toc204225837" class="anchor"></span>Figure 96: Records—Choosing a File to Edit

INPUT TO WHAT FILE:<span class="mark">??</span>

Choose from:

335235 FMUSER’S DATA (7 entries)

335238 PROJECTS (3 entries)

335668 WARD HISTORY (178 entries)

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: <span class="mark">PROJECTS</span>

13. <span id="_Hlt445540463" class="anchor"></span>At the “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompt, choose what fields to edit for each file entry. The easiest response is to just accept the default of ALL fields by pressing the Enter key:

> <span id="_Toc204225838" class="anchor"></span>Figure 97: Records—Choosing the File Fields to Edit

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//

If, however, you want to edit only *certain fields* (*not all* fields), answer the “EDIT WHICH FIELD:” prompt with the name (or number) of the *first* field you want to edit (<u>Figure 98</u>). You can then enter additional fields to edit (when you are done, press the Enter key at the “THEN EDIT FIELD:” prompt). For a list of fields that you can edit, enter two question marks at any “EDIT FIELD:” prompt.

# ScreenMan

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

ScreenMan is VA FileMan’s *screen-oriented* data entry tool. It is an alternative to the Scrolling Mode approach. With ScreenMan, data is entered in *forms*. Each form field occupies a fixed position on the screen (instead of scrolling off!). You can see many data fields at once and use simple key combinations to edit data and move from field to field on a screen. You can also move from one screen to another, like turning through the pages of a book.

## Scrolling Mode Editing vs. Screen Mode Editing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Similarities

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following are similarities when editing in Scrolling Mode and Screen Mode:

- You can change a field’s value by entering a different value or delete a field’s value by entering the at-sign (@).
- You can enter one or two question marks to call up a list of acceptable responses and other help. If you enter a value deemed unacceptable, ScreenMan displays a message explaining what type of information should be entered.
- You can jump from the current field to any other field in your current screen. With your cursor resting at any field’s prompt, simply enter a caret (^) and then the name of the field.

### Differences

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following are differences when editing in Scrolling Mode and Screen Mode:

- In Scrolling Mode, you *must* enter and store your response to one field prompt before you can continue to the next field. In Screen Mode, you can move the cursor from field prompt to field prompt without entering or storing any responses.
- In Scrolling Mode, your data values or responses to field prompts are stored one at a time, as you move from prompt to prompt. In Screen Mode, your responses to most prompts are stored only when you exit the form.
- The “Customize Colors” suboption within ScreenMan allows selection of ANSI colors for all ScreenMan presentations, on a parameterized basis (user, institution, etc.) using Kernel parameters.
- The “ScreenMan Record Selection” page can now be a full ScreenMan page using a COMPUTED Multiple pointer, so that the user can select an entry by scrolling up or down. This feature lets forms contain embedded lookups.
- You can set this up automatically when you create a form. At the query “Do you want you’re Form to begin with a display of all entries, for selection,” answer YES. The initial position can be set to be the user’s last selection, rather than first, last, or new.
- ScreenMan supports the use of a mouse for emulators that support ANSI standard control sequences to turn the mouse on and off. However, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has elected to turn this feature off due to support complications with Attachmate<sup>®</sup> and Micro Focus<sup>®</sup> Reflection terminal emulator software. The DI SCREENMAN NO MOUSE parameter needs to be established for SYSTEM and set to YES.

In this screen capture (<u>Figure 100</u>), you see the following highlighted areas on a sample ScreenMan form:

- Required Fields are <u>underlined</u>.
- Current field where the cursor is active are shown in reverse video (i.e., white text on black background), such as at the “NICK NAME:” field.
- Command Area below the line is where ScreenMan displays messages, help text, and interactive dialog. For example, if you enter one or two question marks in a field, help is displayed in this area.
- Command Line: Here you can issue the commands Exit, Save, Close, Next Page, and Refresh.
- Help Reminder: This reminds the user that to get help at any time, press \<PF1\>H.

Fields are usually composed of a data element and a caption. ScreenMan displays data elements in high intensity (boldface) and other text in regular intensity. Text that identifies a data element is called a caption and is usually followed by a colon (:). A caption and its associated data element are together called a field. Captions of required fields are <u>underlined</u>; to save any changes you make on the form, required fields *must* contain data.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/071.png) NOTE: ScreenMan highlights captions for required fields with an <u>underline</u>. However, on some terminals or depending on your terminal emulator software and your personal preferences, the form of the highlight can vary (e.g., some terminal emulators will highlight required fields in a different color, with an <u>underline</u>, or both).  
  
Specifically, on Qume 102 and Wyse 75 terminals, captions for required fields display in boldface, *not* underlined. Also, the edit window is displayed with an <u>underline</u> extending from the last character of the existing data to the right edge of the edit window. VA FileMan supports longer than 24-line screens for those using terminal emulators.

## Navigation Keystrokes (Cursor Movement)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### How to Navigate between Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

There are several ways you can move the cursor from field to field on a form (i.e., navigate). This is to provide you with as much flexibility as possible so that you can work quickly and efficiently with forms.

You can use the keystrokes listed in <u>Table 23</u> to move the cursor to various fields located on a ScreenMan form:

| To                                                       | Press                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Move to the next field (to right or below).              | \<Tab\>                                          |
| Move to the previous field (to left or above).           | \<PF4\>                                          |
| Move to the field above.                                 | \<Arrow Up\>                                     |
| Move to the field below.                                 | \<Arrow Down\>                                   |
| Move to the next field in the pre-defined edit sequence. | \<Enter\>                                        |
| Edit a WORD-PROCESSING field.                        | At field, press \<Enter\>                        |
| Select a subrecord in a Multiple.                        | At field, press \<Enter\>                        |
| Move to the next block on current page.                  | \<PF1\>\<PF4\>                                   |
| Jump to a specific field.                                | ^ followed by Caption of field and \<Enter\> |
| Jump to the Command Line.                                | ^\<Enter\>                                       |

<span id="_Ref345579028" class="anchor"></span>Table 24: ScreenMan—Keystrokes to Navigate between Pages in a ScreenMan Form

### How to Navigate between Pages

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Many ScreenMan forms have more than one *page* (i.e., there are additional screens besides the first one on the form) with additional fields that you can edit.

You can use the keystrokes listed in <u>Table 24</u> to move between pages on a ScreenMan form:

<table>
<caption><p><span id="_Ref345583017" class="anchor"></span>Table 25: ScreenMan—Command Line Options and Shortcut Keystrokes in a ScreenMan Form</p></caption>

<span id="_Ref345583017" class="anchor"></span>Table 25: ScreenMan—Command Line Options and Shortcut Keystrokes in a ScreenMan Form

### Saving and Exiting

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To SAVE or EXIT the form, you need to reach ScreenMan’s command line. It’s reachable from any ScreenMan screen. To reach the command line, do any one of the following:

- Enter a caret (^) at any field prompt.
- Press Enter, Tab, or PF4 to move from field to field until you reach the command line.
- Press the \<Arrow Down\> or \<Arrow Up\> keys to move the cursor from field to field downwards or upwards, until you reach the command line.

Then you can enter SAVE or EXIT at the [command line](#command-line-options).

### Command Line Options

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

From the Command Line, you can issue commands to perform various functions while in ScreenMan. You can also use a shortcut key sequence to perform the same function without having to enter it on the command line.

#### Shortcut Keys

<u>Table 25</u> lists the command line options and the corresponding shortcut responses while in a ScreenMan form:

## Editing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### How to Edit Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Table 26</u>, <u>Table 27</u>, <u>Table 28</u>, and <u>Table 29</u> list the key sequences for ScreenMan’s Field Editor; the editor that allows you to edit data fields on a ScreenMan Form.

#### Cursor Movement

<u>Table 26</u> lists the keystrokes you use to move the cursor while in a ScreenMan form:

| To Move               | Press                                     |

<span id="_Ref345583054" class="anchor"></span>Table 27: ScreenMan—Keystrokes to Delete Characters in a ScreenMan Form

#### Deletion

<u>Table 27</u> lists the keystrokes you use to delete characters while in a ScreenMan form:

| To Delete                                                  | Press                                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|

<span id="_Ref345583068" class="anchor"></span>Table 28: ScreenMan—Keystrokes to Switch Modes in a ScreenMan Form

#### Modes

<u>Table 28</u> lists the keystrokes you use to switch modes while in a ScreenMan form:

| To Switch to                    | Press        |
|---------------------------------|--------------|
| Insert/Replace mode.            | \<PF3\>  |
| Zoom editor (edit long fields). | \<PF1\>Z |

<span id="_Ref345583086" class="anchor"></span>Table 29: ScreenMan—Keystrokes to Navigate Repeating Blocks in a ScreenMan Form

If the first key you press upon navigating to a field is a printable character, the Field Editor assumes you want to replace any existing default and replaces the entire field with the character just typed. To just edit the existing field value, first press an editing key, such as \<Arrow Left\> or \<Arrow Right\>.

### Long Fields (and the Zoom Editor)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The actual contents of a field being edited can extend beyond the confines of the visible field on a ScreenMan form. As you use the \<Arrow Left\> and \<Arrow Right\> keys at the left and right edges of the window, you can scroll left or right to display one end or the other of the field.

To see and edit the entire contents of a long field at once, press \<PF1\>Z to invoke the Zoom Editor. This opens an area up at the bottom of the screen, providing you as much space as you need to both see and edit the entire long field.

### WORD-PROCESSING Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To edit or display a WORD-PROCESSING field, press the Enter key at the WORD-PROCESSING field. This clears the screen and passes control to your Preferred Editor to edit the field. If you do *not* have a Preferred Editor, the <u>Screen Editor</u> is used. When you exit the editor, you return to the ScreenMan screen.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/073.png) REF: To set your Preferred Editor, see the “<u>Choosing a Preferred Editor</u>” section.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/074.png) NOTE: If the WORD-PROCESSING field is uneditable or appears in a display block, you can view the contents of the field with an editor. However, if you edit the text, your changes are *not* filed in the permanent database, even if you tell the editor to save the changes. A plus sign (+) in a ScreenMan form indicates whether a WORD-PROCESSING field already contains data. If users have their PREFERRED EDITOR field set to SCREEN EDITOR – VA FILEMAN, the previous message “No existing Text” has been modified to “THERE ARE NO LINES!” if a WORD-PROCESSING field has no data.

### Multiples

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You can easily spot a Multiple field. It usually begins with the word “Select” (as in “Select ADDRESS” or “Select ADMISSION DATE”). There are two ways Multiples can be displayed on a form:

- The Multiple is linked to a “popup” subpage, which contains the subfields of the Multiple.
- The Multiple is displayed in a repeating block—several subrecords can be displayed simultaneously on a page, much like a scrolling list and the Multiples within a single SreenMan page can be more than one line deep.

#### Multiples Linked to “Popup” Subpages

A Multiple field can appear on a page and be linked to a regular or “popup” subpage. When you navigate to the Multiple field, select a subrecord, and press Enter, you are taken to the subpage that contains the fields within the Multiple.

In <u>Figure 101</u> the Multiple is the field with the caption “Select SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS:”. When you enter a secondary menu option at this field, you are taken into a “popup” subpage, where you can edit the fields for that particular subrecord:

Close Refresh

Enter a command or ‘^’ followed by a caption to jump to a specific field.

COMMAND: Close Press \<PF1\>H for help Insert

In this example (<u>Figure 101</u>), the popup subpage displays when an entry was made at the “Select SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS” prompt. The user can edit the selected entry for the Multiple in this popup subpage.

#### Exiting a Subpage

While in a subpage, your only Command Line options are [CLOSE](#_Hlt446227361) and [REFRESH](#_Hlt446227363). You *cannot* [EXIT](#_Hlt446227366), [Quit](\l), or [SAVE](#_Hlt446227371) until you return to the parent page. You can return to the parent page by pressing \<PF1\>C or issuing the [CLOSE](#_Hlt446227361) command at the Command Line. From there, you can select another subrecord to edit or navigate to another field.

#### Deleting an Entry in a Multiple

If a default subrecord is displayed at a Multiple field, you can delete that subrecord by entering an at-sign (@) at the Multiple field. You can also delete a specific subrecord by selecting that subrecord and going into the subpage and entering an at-sign (@) at the .01 field.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/075.png) CAUTION: Deletions of subrecords are immediate and permanent; even if you quit the form without saving, deleted subrecords are *not* restored to the database.

#### Adding a New Entry to a Multiple

You can respond to a Multiple field in one of two ways:

- Accept the field’s default answer.
- Enter a new item: an employee’s second address, for example, or another admission date for the same patient.

To enter a new entry in a Multiple, enter the new value for the new entry in the Multiple’s .01 field. If you have LAYGO access (permission to add new entries), you are asked if you want to add the entry to the Multiple. To change your mind about adding the item, enter NO. If you enter YES, though, ScreenMan opens either a “popup” page or a new window, allowing you to enter additional information for the new Multiple entry.

#### Multiples in Repeating Blocks

Subrecords in a Multiple can be displayed in another way. Rather than just the name of single entry in the Multiple being displayed on the current page, you can also see Multiples where several subrecords are displayed simultaneously on the page. Each subrecord occupies one line on the screen, in a scrolling list. This is called a repeating block. Instead of leading to a “popup” page, you can edit all visible fields in the Multiple as they are displayed.

For example:

In this example (<u>Figure 102</u>), the employment data is the Repeated Block for the Multiple. There are four entries in the Multiple that are visible. The plus sign (+) indicates more records exist in the list above.

You can always navigate to a blank line below the end of the list. At this blank line, you can add a new subrecord if LAYGO is allowed or jump to an existing subrecord by entering its name.

## Details

### How to File Edits

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In general, the database is unaffected while you edit a record in a ScreenMan form. Changes are filed only at your request, when you [SAVE](#_Hlt446227371) or [EXIT](#_Hlt446227366).

Before filing, ScreenMan checks that:

- Required fields on all pages that can be accessed via the Next and Previous page links have values, even if you have *not* accessed those pages during the editing session.
- If you have accessed any subpages, required fields in those subpages *must* also have values.

If any required field is empty, you *cannot* file any data changes. When you attempt to file, ScreenMan displays a list of those fields that require values.

The \<PF1\>Q key sequence allows you to [Quit](#_Hlt446227368) the form without saving changes. Filing does *not* occur if you time out.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/076.png) CAUTION: There is one situation in which a change to the database is made immediately: when you delete an entry from a file or subfile. When you attempt to delete an entry, ScreenMan issues a warning that deletions are immediate and permanent. Even if you [Quit](#_Hlt446227368) the form without [saving](#_Hlt446227371) your changes, the entry is *not* restored to the database.

### Troubleshooting

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

While screen displays offer many advantages, they also require that the software can correctly identify the type of terminal being used or emulated. An incorrect identification may produce unreadable and unusable screens. To exit such a screen, enter ^\<Enter\>^\<Enter\>.

If you continue to find the screens are unreadable, check the following sources for troubleshooting information:

- “System Management” section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual* (e.g., the “Device Handling for Standalone VA FileMan” section).
- *Kernel 8.0 Systems Management: Device Handler User Guide* (look for information on “Device Type at Signon” and changing your terminal type).
- Systems Administrator.

# Word-Processing Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Word-Processing Editors

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

WORD-PROCESSING-type fields are typically used so that you can write, edit, and format text for letters and reports, text information in patient records, electronic MailMan messages, application packages, responses, and so on.

VA FileMan provides two editors for WORD-PROCESSING fields:

- <u>Line Editor</u>
- <u>Screen Editor</u>

The system manager can provide other editors as well (e.g., Extensible Editor).

You can select any of the available editors on the system as your Preferred Editor. If you select a Preferred Editor that editor is used whenever you edit a WORD-PROCESSING field. If you *do not* choose a Preferred Editor, the following defaults are used:

- <u>Line Editor</u>—When editing WORD-PROCESSING fields from Scrolling Mode.
- <u>Screen Editor</u>—When editing WORD-PROCESSING fields from a ScreenMan form.

## Choosing a Preferred Editor

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To select your preferred editor, perform the following procedure:

1.  At any menu prompt, enter “TBOX" to go to the User’s Toolbox \[XUSERTOOLS\] menu.
15. From the User’s Toolbox \[XUSERTOOLS\] menu, choose the Edit User Characteristics \[XUSEREDITSELF\] option.
16. At the “Select TERMINAL TYPE NAME:" prompt, you can usually just accept the default by pressing the Enter key.
17. You are now placed in a ScreenMan form where you can edit your user characteristics. Press \<Arrow Down\> until your cursor arrives at the “PREFERRED EDITOR:” prompt.
18. At the “PREFERRED EDITOR:” prompt, you can choose your Preferred Editor. Enter two question marks (??) to get a list of the available editors on your system. Choose one as your Preferred Editor and then press the Enter key. The Screen Editor is usually a good choice.
19. Press \<PF1\>E to exit the <u>ScreenMan</u> form. If you are asked whether to save changes before leaving the form, answer YES.

Your Preferred Editor should now be set to the editor you have chosen. This is the editor that is used whenever you edit the contents of a WORD-PROCESSING field.

## Switching to another Editor While Editing

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Selecting your default editor determines which editor is used whenever you edit a WORD-PROCESSING field. However, if you want to *temporarily* switch to another editor once you have started editing, both the Screen Editor and the Line Editor allow you to do this:

- In the <u>Screen Editor</u>:
1.  Press \<PF1\>A.
20. Choose the editor to which you wish to switch.
- In the <u>Line Editor</u>:
1.  Choose the Utilities in Word-processing option.
21. At the “Edit Option:” prompt, choose Editor Change.
22. Choose the editor to which you wish to switch.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/077.png) REF: For more information on the Screen Editor, see the “<u>Screen Editor</u>” section. For more information on the Line Editor, see the “<u>Line Editor</u>” section.

# Screen Editor

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To edit the contents of DATA TYPE field values of WORD-PROCESSING in files, you need to use a word-processing editor. VA FileMan provides two standard editors:

- Screen Editor
- <u>Line Editor</u>

The Screen Editor provides flexibility and freedom *not* provided by the <u>Line Editor</u>. The Screen Editor provides such features as the following:

- Full-screen editing
- Automatic text wrapping
- Search-and-replace

In most cases, you would want your default editor to be the Screen Editor.

For most people, the Screen Editor should be your Preferred Editor for WORD-PROCESSING fields.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/078.png) REF: To set your default editor, see the “<u>Choosing a Preferred Editor</u>” section. This section also explains how you can switch your current editor on-the-fly.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/079.png) REF: For more information on the Line Editor, see the “<u>Line Editor</u>” section.

If you enter \<PF1\>H at any time in the Screen Editor, you can get online help that lists all the available commands.

At any time, while entering text using the Screen Editor, you can select a command. For example, at any time you can change your left margin, move to a different screen, save your document, or get online help. To invoke most commands, you need to enter only two keystrokes: the \<PF1\> key and a character key, such as D for delete line.

You usually find the \<PF\> keys at the top or right-hand side of your terminal keyboard, along with the numeric keypad. If you are using a personal computer rather than a computer terminal, the \<PF\> keys are most likely re-mapped to another set of keys (consult your system administrator to find out to what keys the \<PF1\> through \<PF4\> are re-mapped).

## Screen Editor Screen

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Screen Editor display consists of a status bar at the top and a ruler at the bottom. Between the two status bars is the area where you create and edit text, as shown <u>Figure 103</u>:

<span id="_Ref345588527" class="anchor"></span>Figure 103: Screen Editor—Sample WORD-PROCESSING Field in the Screen Editor: Sample Component Parts

## Entering Text

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When using the Screen Editor, you type your text as you normally would. As you type, the Screen Editor automatically wraps lines of text to fit within the left and right margins. There is no need to press the Enter key at the end of each line. The Screen Editor accepts any printable characters as keyboard input. However, it *cannot* be used to edit text that contains control characters.

## Entering Commands

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Editor commands are invoked using keyboard command sequences. The Screen Editor makes use of the \<PF\> keys, the cursor keypad, and, if available on the keyboard, the edit keypad to perform its editing functions.

<span id="_Ref345576275" class="anchor"></span>Table 31: Screen Editor—Keystrokes to Exit and Save Text in the Screen Editor

You can *move forward quickly across a line* by pressing the Tab key (\<Tab\>). The Tab key in the Screen Editor does *not* insert anything into the text. The Tab key is for navigation only and simply moves the cursor to the next tab stop to the right. Another way to move across a line, either forward or backward, is to move a word at a time, using \<Ctrl\>J or \<Ctrl\>L.

## Troubleshooting

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Terminal Type Setting

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Screen Editor is designed for use on all terminal types known in the Kernel computing environment. It is very important that your terminal type be correctly identified to VA FileMan.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/081.png) REF: For more information about how terminal types are identified, see the Kernel documentation located on the [Kernel application on the VDL](https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=10).

Since the \<PF\> keys are used in the Screen Editor, those keys should *not* be reprogrammed.

### \<PF\> Keys Not Working: How to Exit

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If your \<PF\> keys do *not* work in the Screen Editor, your terminal type is probably set incorrectly. Before you can correct the setting, you need to make an emergency exit from the editor by using one of the following keystroke combinations:

- Press \<Esc\>OPQ (if your keyboard has an Escape \[Esc\] key).
- Press \<Ctrl\>\[OPQ (if your keyboard does *not* have an Escape\[Esc\] key).
- Press \<Ctrl\>A@\<Enter\>Q (if *neither* of the above methods work).

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/082.png) NOTE: You *must* enter all letters in the above key sequences in UPPERCASE.

## Screen Editor and Personal Computers

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Pasting and Uploading

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you are accessing your computer system from a personal computer (PC), you can *paste* text from an application on the PC into the Screen Editor, and also *upload* files into the Screen Editor. There are some issues to be aware of when pasting text or uploading files into the Screen Editor.

### Symbol Characters

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Extended ASCII characters (typically “symbol” characters) *cannot* be stored in WORD-PROCESSING fields. Examples of such characters include:

- “Smart Quote” characters
- Bullets
- Symbols

Such characters, when encountered, are stripped or replaced with a space, ‘, “, or \*, as appropriate. To avoid problems uploading these types of characters, you should:

- Turn off “Smart Quotes” in your word-processor on your personal computer.
- Avoid using bullets.
- Avoid using symbols in your text such as: ¼, ½ , and º.

### Files: Save as Text

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you are uploading an entire word-processing document (as opposed to pasting), save it first as a “Text Only with Line Breaks” (or similar) file type in your personal computer word-processor.

### Wrap Vs. No Wrap

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If your source document contains a carriage return at the end of every line, turn WRAP off in the Screen Editor *before* you paste or upload by pressing PF2. Turn it back on once the paste or upload is completed. If your source document contains a carriage return at the end of each paragraph only; however, leave WRAP on in the Screen Editor.

### Avoiding Lost Characters

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If the host computer system *cannot* keep up with the text upload, characters can get “lost.” This can be a factor if you upload large quantities of text or characters. This character loss can occur because pastes and ASCII uploads do *not* use *error*-correcting communications protocols.

If you notice characters getting lost, one way to solve this is to adjust the “character pacing” (or similar) setting in your terminal emulation program. This can slow down the transfer of text such that characters no longer get lost due to communications overload.

If you need to paste or upload large quantities of text, consider switching to an Alternate Editor (e.g., Kermit) that uses an *error*-correcting communications protocol. This automatically compensates for communications overflows, preventing the loss of characters during text transfer.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/083.png) NOTE: To use Kermit, it *must* be installed as an Alternate Editor at your site.

# Line Editor

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Line Editor is a scrolling mode editor. It is the second of two standard editors VA FileMan provides for editing WORD-PROCESSING-type fields. The distinguishing characteristic of a Scrolling Mode editor is that you enter your text one line at a time, and that you can only edit lines one at a time. Because word-processing in a scrolling mode interface can be cumbersome, you can set your Preferred Editor to the <u>Screen Editor</u>. VA FileMan continues to provide the Scrolling-Mode Line Editor, however, for those who prefer it.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/084.png) REF: To set your default editor, see the “<u>Choosing a Preferred Editor</u>” section.  
  
> **NOTE:** For most people, the <u>Screen Editor</u> should be your Preferred Editor for WORD-PROCESSING fields.

## Recognizing the Line Editor

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you edit a WORD-PROCESSING field, it’s easy to see if VA FileMan chooses the Line Editor as your editor. If the Line Editor is used, the last nine lines of text (if there are that many) are displayed on the screen, with numbered prompts at the start of each line. Also, after the text is listed, you are prompted with “EDIT Option:”. The “EDIT Option:” prompt is where you can enter each Line Editor command to work with the text.

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225846" class="anchor"></span>Figure 105: Line Editor—Example of a WORD-PROCESSING Field in the Line Editor

HISTORY:

1\>Owing to poverty in early youth, patient seems not to

2\>have had proper diet. Since achieving economic success,

3\>his diet has been adequate, but traces of original

4\>deficiency remain.

5\>

EDIT Option:

## How to Enter Text in the Line Editor

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If no text exists yet in a WORD-PROCESSING field that you are about to edit, you see the field name followed by “1\>”. This is the Line Editor’s prompt for entering WORD-PROCESSING text.

For example:

<span id="_Toc204225847" class="anchor"></span>Figure 106: Line Editor—Prompts for Entering Word-Processing Text

Select PATIENT FILE NAME: <span class="mark">FMPATIENT,FOUR</span>

Select DIAGNOSIS: ANGINA PECTORIS// <span class="mark">B-12 DEFICIENCY</span>

HISTORY:

1\>

You can now enter the text for Line 1 and press the Enter key. This brings you to a prompt “2\>” for Line 2, and so forth. Keep adding lines until you are done; then, press the Enter key on a blank line to finish your edit, as shown in <u>Figure 107</u>:

<span id="_Ref523922313" class="anchor"></span>Figure 107: Line Editor—Completing Your Edits in the Line Editor

## Revising Existing Text

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To revise the contents of the WORD-PROCESSING field, you need to call up each individual line that you want to edit and then edit each line.

To revise existing text, perform the following procedure:

1.  At the “EDIT Option:” prompt, enter the letter E for Edit a Line (Replace \_\_ With \_\_).
27. At the “Edit line:” prompt, enter the number of the line you need to revise.
28. Beneath the “EDIT Option:” and “Edit line:” prompts, you see the line of text that you identified by number and you see the “Replace” prompt.
29. Enter a string in the current line to be replaced.
30. If the string you enter is found in the current line, set the “With” prompt. Enter a string to replace the original string.
31. The line is now updated, and you are prompted for another string to replace. If you are done editing the line, simply press the Enter key.

### Shortcut: Enter Line Number to Edit at “EDIT Option:” Prompt

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

There’s a shortcut to edit a particular line. At the “EDIT Option:” prompt, instead of choosing the Edit a Line (Replace \_\_ With \_\_) option and entering the line number, just enter the line number instead. You are taken directly to the line you specify, and then given the “Replace” prompt to edit the line:

<span id="_Toc204225849" class="anchor"></span>Figure 108: Line Editor—Shortcut to Edit a Specific Line Using the Line Editor

## “Replace...With” Edits: Be Careful

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When editing individual lines, you make changes using the “Replace...With” dialog, where you enter an existing string in the line, and a new string with which to replace it. Be careful as you enter your responses to the “Replace” and “With” prompts. Enter enough letters to ensure that the computer replaces the desired string of characters.

Here is why this issue is so important. In one line, you may have two identical words, or you may have two identical sets of characters embedded. Since the computer changes only the *first* occurrence of any series of letters that you enter, review your line carefully before responding to the “Replace” prompt. Then enter enough identifying characters to correct the specific word or characters you wish to change. To illustrate the point, look at an incorrect entry (<u>Figure 109</u>).

In <u>Figure 109</u>, you need to change the sentence in the second line from “This example is sample” to the sentence “This example is simple.”

<span id="_Ref523927459" class="anchor"></span>Figure 109: Line Editor—Example of an *Incorrect* Edit with the “Replace...With” Editor

EDIT Option: <span class="mark">2</span>

2\>This ex<span class="mark">ample</span> is s<span class="mark">ampl</span>e

Replace <span class="mark">ample</span> With <span class="mark">imple</span> Replace <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

This eximple is sample

Edit line:

As you can see from this example (<u>Figure 109</u>), VA FileMan replaced the *first* occurrence of the “ample” characters. Thus, “example” was changed to “eximple” rather than “sample” being changed to “simple” because the word “example” came before the word “simple” in the sentence (i.e., it was the first occurrence). Obviously, you should have replaced the whole word “sample” with “simple” to avoid any confusion.

### Shortcuts at the “Replace...With” Prompt

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

As with editing long field values, you can replace long strings of characters by using ellipses. An ellipsis is three successive periods (...). When editing, you can replace longer strings of characters by using an ellipsis at the “Replace” prompt. You can specify ranges of text to replace for any line (just as with a long text field) with the ellipsis.

For example, to replace an entire line at a “Replace...With” prompt, enter the ellipsis (three periods) at the “Replace” prompt. You are then able to replace the entire default with what you entered at the “With” prompt, as shown in <u>Figure 110</u>:

<span id="_Ref523927771" class="anchor"></span>Figure 110: Line Editor—Using the Ellipsis (…) to Replace an Entire Line

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Assume that you have just entered four lines of text in a WORD-PROCESSING field and would now like to review the entire text. After entering text on Line 4 (4\>), press the Enter key. When prompted for Line 5 (5\>), press the Enter key again and you arrive at the “EDIT Option:” prompt. Enter L (for List a Range of Lines option) and choose the range of lines to list (in this case, Lines 1 to 4):

EDIT Option:

### ADD: Append More Text

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

After listing lines of text (see “[LIST: List the Message](#list-list-the-message)” section), suppose you need to add a few comments at the end of your message. From the “EDIT Option:” prompt, enter A (for Add Lines to End of Text option). You can now add additional lines:

<span id="_Toc204225854" class="anchor"></span>Figure 113: Line Editor—Example Using the Add Lines to End of Text Option

7\> <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

### JOIN: Combine Two Lines of Text

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Suppose you are at the “EDIT Option:” prompt. After briefly reviewing your text, you have decided that Lines 2 and 3 (2\> and 3\>) are too short. You can use the Join command (i.e., Join Line to the One Following option) to join Line 2 to the next line:

<span id="_Toc204225855" class="anchor"></span>Figure 114: Line Editor—Example Using the Join Line to the One Following Option

EDIT Option:

### INSERT: Insert New Lines of Text between Existing Ones

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Suppose that you want to insert new lines of text in the middle of existing text in a WORD-PROCESSING field. Using the [Add Lines to End of Text](#Add) does *not* work, because that appends new text lines at the *end* of the existing lines. Instead, you can use the Insert command \[i.e., Insert Lines after an Existing Line option\], to do this:

<span id="_Toc204225856" class="anchor"></span>Figure 115: Line Editor—Example Using the Insert Lines after an Existing Line Option

EDIT Option: <span class="mark">L \<Enter\></span> ist line: 1// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span> to: 5// <span class="mark">\<Enter\></span>

## Advanced Features

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Most of the features of the Line Editor are self-explanatory and simple to use. However, a few require additional explanation, as follows in this section.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/085.png) NOTE: To see a full list of the commands available at the “EDIT Option:” prompt, enter two question marks (??), as shown in <u>Figure 111</u>.

### File Transfer (Use When Uploading ASCII Text)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The File Transfer from Foreign CPU option from the Utility menu lets you upload text from another system into your WORD-PROCESSING field text, using an ASCII (*non-error*-correcting) transfer. For example, if you are connected from a personal computer (PC), you can use your communication software to send a text file.

The file to be transferred *must* be a text (pure ASCII) file. Most word-processing programs have a way of saving a document as text (i.e., without special formatting information); check your word-processor’s manual. Also, you need to know how to send a text file using your PC’s communication software; if you are not sure how, check your communications software manual.

To use the File Transfer from Foreign CPU option, perform the following procedure:

1.  Make sure the file you are transferring is a pure ASCII text file.
32. While editing a WORD-PROCESSING field in the Line Editor, choose the Utility menu option at the “EDIT Option:” prompt. Then choose the File Transfer from Foreign CPU option from the Utility menu.
33. At the “MAXIMUM string length? : (3-245):” prompt, enter maximum string length for lines you are uploading.
34. The Line Editor now waits up to 30 seconds for you to initiate an ASCII transfer of the file.
35. Use your communications software to perform an ASCII upload of the file. All uploaded text is appended to the WORD-PROCESSING field that you are editing.
36. Once you have finished uploading, it takes 30 seconds of inactivity until the transfer can complete. When done, and after 30 seconds of inactivity, the computer responds, “FILE TRANSFER COMPLETE” and you are returned to the “EDIT Option:” prompt.

The same precautions apply for uploading large quantities of text to the Line Editor as apply with the <u>Screen Editor</u>. In particular, if you need to upload large quantities of text quickly, consider switching to an Alternate Editor, such as Kermit (if installed as an Alternate Editor by your site), which provides *error*-correcting communications protocol. Unlike an ASCII transfer (used with the File Transfer option), an error-correcting protocol (e.g., Kermit) can transfer text and automatically compensate for any communications overflows, without losing characters.

### Text Terminator-String Change

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/086.png) NOTE: Use this when uploading text with blank lines.

In the Line Editor, a blank line (NULL string) signals the end of data entry (and returns you to the “EDIT Option:” prompt. Thus, if you plan to *paste* or *upload* text into the Line Editor from a personal computer, any blank lines in the uploaded text have the side-effect of signaling the end of data entry (prematurely). One way around this is to use the [File Transfer from Foreign CPU option](#Transfer). Another way around this problem is to use the Text-Terminator-String Change option on the Utility menu. This lets you change the text terminator so that some character string, rather than a blank line, is what is used to signal the end of data entry.

You can change the text terminator to any string of between one and five characters; question marks (?) or carets (^) are *not* allowed in the string. To finish editing a WORD-PROCESSING field and get to the “EDIT Option:” prompt, simply enter your new text terminator string instead of pressing the Enter key on a blank line. You should choose a text terminator that does *not* appear in your text: “end” would *not* be a good choice, but “EnD” might be.

The new text terminator is *not permanent*; it remains only as long as you are editing a particular WORD-PROCESSING field. You can change it back to a NULL line by entering an at-sign (@) at the “Text-Terminator:” prompt. You can permanently change your default text terminator by changing it in your user characteristics as described in the Kernel manuals.

### Programmer Edit (Edit Lines with M Commands)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Y-Programmer Edit option (invoked by entering the letter Y) is only available to users with Programmer’s access. You can enter a line of M code that, line-by-line, reads in the current line in variable X and returns the transformed line in variable Y. You can specify the range of lines to be transformed by the M code you enter.

For example, to blank out all lines containing the words “Top Secret”, you could enter the following M code:

<span id="_Toc204225858" class="anchor"></span>Figure 117: Line Editor—Example of Entering M Code while Using the Y-Programmer Edit Option

EDIT Option: <span class="mark">Y</span>

The text is in X and returned in Y

Enter MUMPS xecute string to do transformation: <span class="mark">I X\[“Top Secret” S Y=“ “</span>

### Editor Change: Switch Editors

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Editor Change option, on the Utility menu, shows you a list of the editors available for your use, if you enter two question marks (??) at the “Select ALTERNATE EDITOR:” prompt. The editors include VA FileMan’s own editors (the Line Editor and Screen Editor) and any other editors to which you have access. You choose the editor to use by entering its name. When you exit your chosen editor, you return to the Line Editor’s “EDIT option:” prompt.

### Transfer Text (from another WORD-PROCESSING Field)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Transfer Lines From Another Document option lets you copy text from some other WORD-PROCESSING field into your current field. You need to specify on which line of the current field to place the incoming text and identify the source of the text.

To identify the source of the text, you need to use extended pointer syntax.

![](fm-22-2-user-manual/087.png) REF: The extended pointer syntax is described in the “Relational Navigation” section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual*.

The syntax lets you specify the field of a specific entry in a specific file. Briefly, the syntax can be in one of the following two forms:

\<*expression*\>:\<*file*\>:\<*field*\>

Or

\<*expression*\> IN \<*file*\> FILE:\<*field*\>

The \<*expression*\> or lookup value has several possible forms. One way to refer to the field is by entry name. To retrieve text from the WORD-PROCESSING PROGNOSIS field of the entry Angina Pectoris in a (fictitious) file named DIAGNOSES, you could enter the following, as shown in <u>Figure 118</u>:

<span id="_Ref523930871" class="anchor"></span>Figure 118: Line Editor—Dialog of the Extended Pointer Syntax while Using the Transfer Lines From Another Document Option: Sample User Entries at Prompts (Example \#1)

EDIT Option: <span class="mark">T \<Enter\></span> ransfer incoming text after line: <span class="mark">1</span>

From what text: <span class="mark">?</span>

Select another entry in this file, OR

use relational syntax to pick up information from a word-

processing field in another file.

ex. “VALUE”:FILE NAME:WORD PROCESSING FIELD NAME

Do you want the entire TEST list?

Enter Yes or No: <span class="mark">^</span>

From what text: <span class="mark">“Angina Pectoris”:DIAGNOSES:PROGNOSIS</span>

From line: <span class="mark">1 \<Enter\></span> thru: <span class="mark">20</span>

ARE YOU SURE? NO// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES)... . .

Alternatively, you can use the second syntax to retrieve the same field in the same file entry, as shown in <u>Figure 119</u>:

<span id="_Ref345588550" class="anchor"></span>Figure 119: Line Editor—Dialog of the Extended Pointer Syntax while Using the Transfer Lines From Another Document Option: Sample User Entries at Prompts (Example \#2)

EDIT Option: <span class="mark">T \<Enter\></span> ransfer incoming text after line: <span class="mark">4</span>

From what text: <span class="mark">“Angina Pectoris” IN DIAGNOSIS FILE:PROGNOSIS</span>

From line: <span class="mark">1 \<Enter\></span> thru: <span class="mark">20</span>

ARE YOU SURE? NO// <span class="mark">Y \<Enter\></span> (YES) ...

In this example, at the "From what text:" prompt:

- "Angina Pectoris" is the entry name.
- DIAGNOSIS is the file name.
- Prognosis is the field name.

The requested text is identified by the value of the .01 field in quotes (“Angina Pectoris”). Thus, in this example the *\<expression\>* is the entry’s name. You also specify which lines you want to transfer. If you enter one question mark (?) at the “From line:” prompt, you can list the current numbered lines in the WORD-PROCESSING field. You can then easily choose the lines to be transferred.

If the field from which you are transferring text displays text without wrapping, you receive the message shown in <u>Figure 120</u>:

<span id="_Ref389661772" class="anchor"></span>Figure 120: Line Editor—Example of a Possible Warning Message when Using the Transfer Lines From Another Document Option

WARNING!

The field you are transferring text from displays text without wrapping.

The field you are transferring text into may display text differently.

Do you want to continue?

Enter Yes or No:

Consider the possibility that the text transferred from the no-wrap field may be unreadable, if the field you are transferring into does wrap text. For example, a spreadsheet might lose the alignment of its columns.

If the transfer fails, the message \<no change\> is shown. The transfer might fail for several reasons:

- Incorrect syntax for the extended pointer.
- An attempted transfer from other than a WORD-PROCESSING field type.
