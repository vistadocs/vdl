VA FileMan has provided basic file access control since its inception. It allows Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) applications to define letter-based codes that can be assigned to users to grant access to the data in a given file. This access could differ for various actions, such as:
- Reading data
- Writing data
- Access to the file’s data dictionary
Kernel 8.0 released the File Access Security module. It expanded upon this concept via an explicit list in the NEW PERSON (#200) file of the files that each user may access and how.
Both of these methods permit or deny a user access to specific fields, or the file as a whole. Applications face an additional access control issue at the record level. Often users may view final or verified data but anything that is still considered “draft” is usually restricted via application options. Sensitive or “removed” (i.e., entered in error) data is often hidden. Actions available to take on a record can vary depending upon its current state or the credentials of an individual user.
VistA application developers have traditionally coded these behaviors, generally known as business rules, into their application options and remote procedure calls (RPCs). New Web clients are accessing data via services instead of RPCs. The Data Access Control (DAC) utility was developed to save those business rules in a place that can be called within a Web service. Applications can also use this tool directly within their own code for consistency. Potentially, VA FileMan application programming interfaces (APIs) could use this type of access control.
The Data Access Control utility, released with VA FileMan Patch DI\*22.2\*8, is based upon the XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) standard, an extension of XML. XACML assumes an attribute-based rule structure that can permit or deny a user access to a resource (e.g., a record in a file). It uses pre-defined target attribute values to match appropriate policies to the action being taken. Policies are made up of rules that can be combined as needed. This allows you to create simple or very complex access policies.

## What is a Policy?

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A policy is a set of rules that specify who may access a record, and how. Attribute name-value pairs, called targets, determine if the policy applies to a record; a conjunction can be used to indicate if all targets *must* match the record, or if only one match suffices. Each rule in a policy can have its own targets, to return different results based on different attribute values. Policies can return a message when a result is determined, and/or execute M code to perform a task, such as logging a user’s access to the file.

## Creating a Policy

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When creating a policy you first identify the business rules that determine how to appropriately handle the data. For example, Lab wants to restrict who may view results before they are verified. In this example, a policy can be created for reading data from the LAB DATA (#63) file. This policy would have rules to permit or deny access based on the status of the result and the credentials of each user.

### Create the Rules

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A rule can be created for each possible scenario that *must* be considered. You need to define the following:

- <u>Target</u>—Criteria for applying the rule.
- <u>Condition</u>—Any conditions to be evaluated if the rule applies.
- <u>Result</u>—Result to return if the conditions are true.

#### Target

The target is a set of attributes that determine if the rule applies to a record. The name and desired value of each attribute is stored in a sub-file with the rule. A conjunction can be used to indicate if all targets *must* match, or if at least one suffices to apply the rule.

#### Condition

Rules can have additional conditions, which are simply Boolean expressions that are evaluated to determine the result of the rule, when it is applied. A condition points to an entry in the [POLICY FUNCTION (#1.62)](#policy_function_file) file, and can include a value for comparison. Conditions are particularly useful for evaluating requirements that are external to the record, such as user credentials. For example, VA FileMan provides a condition function to check if the user holds a specified security key. A conjunction can be used to indicate if all conditions *must* be true, or at least one, for the rule to be considered true.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/003.png) REF: For a list of exported DI\* functions, see “<u>Appendix B—Exported DI\* Functions</u>.”

#### Result

The result is the intended consequence or effect of the rule, if it applies and the conditions evaluate to true. Possible values are either:

- Permit
- Deny

Depending on the result of the rule, each rule can also:

- Return a message.
- Process an obligation function.

The function is M code stored as an entry in the [POLICY FUNCTION (#1.62)](#policy_function_file) file. It is executed based on the result and can perform tasks, such as logging access that has been granted or denied.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/004.png) REF: For a list of exported DI\* functions, see “<u>Appendix B—Exported DI\* Functions</u>.”

### Create the Policy

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Related rules can be collected together into a single policy, which can be evaluated to permit or deny access to a record. A policy can have its own set of target attributes, as well as messages and functions.

A policy should also include an attribute function. This is M code that is stored as an entry in the [POLICY FUNCTION (#1.62)](#policy_function_file) file, which extracts the attribute values from the record and stores them in the DIVAL array by subscripts that match the target names used in the policy and its rules.

Because a policy usually contains multiple rules, a result function *must* be defined as well. This is M code that is stored as an entry in the [POLICY FUNCTION (#1.62)](#policy_function_file) file, which based on the current value of the local variable DIRESULT sets the local variable Y to either of the following:

- 1—True
- 0—False

A policy can loop through rules until the following:

- Permit result occurs.
- Deny is encountered.
- Quits when any result is determined.

Some result functions can provide a default result if no policy or rule is found that applies to the record. VA FileMan provides five result functions that handle the most common combining algorithms.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/005.png) REF: For more information on result functions, see the “<u>Functions</u>” section.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/006.png) REF: For a list of exported DI\* functions, see “<u>Appendix B—Exported DI\* Functions</u>.”

#### Functions

The [POLICY FUNCTION (#1.62)](#policy_function_file) file contains the following function types:

- Attribute—Written by the application developer to extract values from the record that are used to determine which policies and rules apply; it should populate the array DIVAL(“attribute”)=“value”, where ‘attribute’ matches the policy or rule targets.
- Obligation—Provided by the application developer to perform any needed tasks when a Permit or Deny result is obtained, such as logging access to a file. No input or output is required.
- Condition—Provides additional checks for rules that apply. VA FileMan exports a few common functions, but others can be provided by the developer as needed. A value can be specified to compare against, and is available for use in the function code as the variable X; the variable Y *must* be returned as:
- 1—True
- 0—False
- Result—Provided by VA FileMan; examine the variable DIRESULT to determine if a policy is satisfied. Like conditions, the variable Y is returned as either:
- 1—True
- 0—False

When function code is executed, the variable IEN holds the pointer to the [POLICY (#1.6)](#policy_file) file for the policy or rule being evaluated.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/007.png) REF: For a list of exported DI\* functions, see “<u>Appendix B—Exported DI\* Functions</u>.”

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/008.png) REF: For the full list of local variables that can be referenced, see “<u>Appendix A—Key DI\* Variables</u>.”

#### Application Actions

The [APPLICATION ACTION (#1.61)](#application_action_file) file contains the actions that can be taken on a record in a given VistA file or sub-file. Each entry consists of a valid VistA file or sub-file number, and the free text name of an action that is supported by its application (e.g., read, cancel, sign, etc.).

A policy can be linked to an Application Action. When the policy evaluation API is invoked, the file number and action name passed in are used to find a match in this file; its associated policy is then evaluated to return a data access authorization result of Permit or Deny. More than one Application Action can be assigned the same policy.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/009.png) NOTE: A policy *must* be linked to an Application Action to be evaluated for Data Access Control.

## Distribution Files

# Policy Editor

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Data Access Control (DAC) utility provides a Policy Editor to facilitate creation and management of data access control policies. Policy members are indented in the list to show the membership hierarchy, with common actions and utilities available in the action menu below.

## Policy

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<u>Figure 1</u> and <u>Figure 2</u> are examples of creating a sample policy to view Chemistry results. Invoke the Policy Editor via the Data Access Control options on the VA FileMan Other Options menu, and create a new policy called LR CH READ.

## Add/Remove Members—Adding Rules

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The content of the new policy consists of a rule for each possible status of a result. Use the Add/Remove Members action to create a rule for the Preliminary (P) status. If the rule does *not* exist, you are first allowed to create it and complete the most commonly used fields.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/010.png) NOTE: The type of Rule is assumed, for policy members.

Finally, a Sequence number *must* be assigned for the new rule within the policy’s Members sub-file, as shown in <u>Figure 3</u>.

Targets should be defined with a name and value that describe the desired rule. Use the VA FileMan DI HAS KEY function to check if the user holds the key named in the VALUE field.

If a rule that already exists is added to a policy, only the Members Sequence is prompted.

## Edit a Policy

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Edit a Policy action invokes a ScreenMan form, which allows reviewing and editing of any rule or policy in the list. All fields are presented for editing, but *not* all need to be completed for every rule or policy. For example, an Attribute Function is usually only defined for the policy, and *not* needed for every rule as well.

Besides its Name, only the Result or Result Function is required for rules or policies, respectively. The Conjunction fields are optional unless more than one target or condition is entered.

### Messages

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Advice messages can contain dynamic text, if needed, by using the VA FileMan text bar syntax; in the above example, the name of the user is inserted into the Deny Message when returned. The name of a local variable, or the name of an attribute (i.e., a subscript) in the DIVAL array, can be placed between two vertical bars; when the message is returned, the value of the variable or attribute is inserted into the text.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/011.png) REF: For the full list of local variables that can be referenced, see “<u>Appendix A—Key DI\* Variables</u>.”

### Available Fields

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Not every action on a file requires accessing every field; a developer may want to specify the fields that are appropriate to view or modify. Available Fields can hold a string that can be used as the DR variable in any standard VA FileMan API call. This string is returned to the calling client or application when a Permit result is obtained. Continuation strings, or specific fields within a sub-file, can be included by creating an entry in the Additional Fields list.

Field strings can be saved at any level of a policy hierarchy, including the associated Application Action. The lowest level in the hierarchy that determined the Permit result takes precedence, and its DR string is returned. It is *recommended* that a default field string be saved at the highest level appropriate, for example with the Action or primary Policy. If exceptions are needed, they should be saved with the rule that grants access under those conditions to override the default string.

## Delete a Policy

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

A rule or policy can be removed from the current policy tree by using either the Add/Remove Members or Edit a Policy action. The Delete a Policy action completely removes a rule or policy from the [POLICY (#1.6)](#policy_file) file, and cleans up all pointers to that item.

## Disable a Policy

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Disable a Policy action changes the value of the DISABLE (#.03) field in the [POLICY (#1.6)](#policy_file) file. If it is set to YES, the policy and all of its descendant members are *not* processed when testing or running the policy evaluation API. A disabled policy can also be re-enabled via this action.

Use the Functions action in the Policy Editor to review existing functions, or create new ones. It is *highly recommended* when creating your own functions to document all input and output variables, including source fields, in the Description. VA FileMan reserves the internal entry numbers less than 1000 for its own use, and those functions are *not* editable. You can also assign the function to a policy from within this option, without having to go back into the Edit screens.

### Test Utility Output

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If you answered YES to showing the execution trace, the first thing shown in the VA FileMan Browser is a list of the local DI variables in use. For example:

<span id="_Toc482181917" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Test Policy Action—Sample DI Variables in Use

DIACT = 5

DIACTN = read

DIENS =

DIFN = 63.04

DIPOL = 1

DIUSR = 1000406

DIVAL("resultStatus") = P

Second, the execution trace itself is displayed, indenting each level while drilling down into the hierarchy. For example:

<span id="_Toc482181918" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Test Policy Action—Sample Execution Trace

LR CH READ: DIPOL=1 (DIFN=63.04 & DIACTN=read)

LR READ FINAL: \<not a match\>

LR READ PRELIM: resultStatus=P

DI HAS KEY(LRLAB): 0

DIRESULT: D

LR CH READ: First Applicable

The caption is the name of the policy, rule, or function being evaluated; its result is shown to the right of the colon:

- For the top-level policy, the result is the matching policy’s IEN in local variable DIPOL. In the Policy Editor, this is simply the main policy being edited. In practice, this would be the policy found by looking up the File# and Action in the [APPLICATION ACTION (#1.61)](#application_action_file) file.
- Each member policy or rule shows the targets that matched to apply it or “\<not a match\>”.
- Any condition function evaluated is displayed with the rule’s Value in parentheses and the Boolean result after execution.
- When a result is determined for the rule, it is stored in the local variable DIRESULT.
- As each policy is exited, it is re-displayed in the list with its Result Function.

The final result of the policy is always shown. For example:

<span id="_Toc482181919" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Test Policy Action—Final Result

Result: DENY

Possible results are:

- P—Permit
- D—Deny
- -1—Error
- Null—Unknown

Any messages generated based on the result are displayed next, under DIMSG with the number of lines. For example:

<span id="_Toc482181920" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Test Policy Action—Sample Messages Generated Based on the Result

DIMSG: 2

FMUSER,ONE is not authorized to view preliminary results.

Please contact Lab staff.

Similarly, any error messages that occurred are listed under DIERR with the error count.

Finally, the Available Fields strings are displayed as DIFLDS, if defined, with the name of the rule, policy, or action it came from in parentheses. Any Additional Fields are listed below in the DR array format:

DIFLDS(level,subfile#,n) = field string

## Select New Policy

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Select New Policy action allows the user to change the policy that is displayed in the list for editing. A different policy can be selected from the [POLICY (#1.6)](#policy_file) file, or a brand new one can be created as shown earlier on entry to the Policy Editor. The screen will re-display with the new policy and any currently existing members, ready for editing.

## Policy Sets

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

If more complex policies are needed, policies can be grouped into sets. Sets are simply groups of policies or other sets, and each *must* have its own Result Function. A set can also:

- Have its own Attribute Function and target attributes.
- Return a message.
- Define the Available Fields.
- Be linked to an Application Action for data access evaluation.

For example, Lab may wish to create a set to handle all reads from the LAB DATA (#63) file. A policy similar to LR CH READ could be created for each lab section that might include a target of “labSection” to determine which policy applies to the read request.

# Application Programming Interface (API)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## \$\$CANDO^DIAC1(): Policy Evaluation

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Once a policy has been created and tested, it is ready to be used by the new VA FileMan Web service or within an application’s own code. The \$\$CANDO^DIAC1 API evaluates a policy to determine if the action being attempted is permitted.

If a matching entry exists in the [APPLICATION ACTION (#1.61)](#application_action_file) file for the requested action and specified file or sub-file, its policy is evaluated to determine the user’s authorization to access the file and/or record. Policy rules are evaluated in sequence, and processing continues until the stop criteria for the policy is met.

Format

\$\$CANDO^DIAC1(file,iens,action\[,user\]\[,.value\]\[,.fields\]\[,msg_root\]\[,err_root\])

Input Parameters

file: (Required) A VistA file number or sub-file number.

iens: (Required/Optional) Standard IENS string indicating internal entry numbers. It is required if evaluating an action on an existing record.

action: (Required) The API name of the action to be taken on the record; the file and action parameters should identify an entry in the [APPLICATION ACTION (#1.61)](#application_action_file) file.

user: (Optional) Pointer to the NEW PERSON (#200) file; defaults to the current value of DUZ if *not* defined.

value(name): (Optional) Array of additional attribute values to use when evaluating policies, passed by reference in the form:

VALUE(“name”) = “value”

The name-value pairs could match target attributes in the policy for supplementing the results of the Attribute Function, or simply be additional values used by other functions or messages.

fields: (Optional) Local variable that receives output from the call. If the Available Fields have been defined for the application action and its policy returns a permit result, that field string is be returned. If Available Fields have been defined for the policy or rule that determined the result, that string takes precedence over the action’s and be returned instead. Additional Fields can also be returned here, as an array of the same name subscripted by the file or sub-file number.

![](fm-22-2-data-access-control-dac-user-guide/018.png) NOTE: This variable is killed at the beginning of each call.

msg_root: (Optional) Closed root into which any relevant advice messages is returned. If this parameter is *not* passed, the array is put into nodes descendant from ^TMP(“DIMSG”,\$J).

err_root: (Optional) Closed root into which the error messages are returned. If this parameter is *not* passed, the array is put into nodes descendant from ^TMP(“DIERR”,\$J).

Output

This Boolean extrinsic function returns the following:

- 1—If authorization is permitted (Permit).
- 0—If authorization is denied (Deny).
- Null—If authorization *cannot* be determined (i.e., no policies exist in the [POLICY \[#1.6\]](#policy_file) file that apply).
- -1—Error.

Advice messages can be returned for either a Permit or Deny result. Available Fields are only returned on a Permit.

### Examples

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To check the current user’s authorization to view a chemistry result using our sample Lab policy, a simple call could be made to the API:

\>S OK=\$\$CANDO^DIAC1(63.04,“7019779.8679,12345,”,“read”) W !,OK

1

A different user may *not* be permitted to view the result, and the message array can show why:

\>S OK=\$\$CANDO^DIAC1(63.04,“7019779.8679,12345,”,“read”,1000406,,,“ZZMSG”)

\>W OK,! ZW ZZMSG

0

ZZMSG(1)=“FMUSER,ONE is not authorized to view preliminary results.”

ZZMSG(2)=“Please contact Lab staff.”

An incomplete call to the API returns an error:

\>S OK=\$\$CANDO^DIAC1(63.04,“7019779.8679,12345,”,,,,,“ZZMSG”,“ZZERR”)

\>W OK,! ZW ZZERR

-1

ZZERR(1)=“The input parameter that identifies the ACTION is missing or invalid.”

# Appendix A—Key DI\* Variables

These key DI\* variables are either passed into the <u>\$\$CANDO^DIAC1(): Policy Evaluation</u> API, or are set by VA FileMan. They can be referenced in function code as read-only, except for the DIVAL array, which *must* be set by the Attribute Functions.
