## Orientation

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

All test data used in this tutorial (e.g., names, Social Security Numbers \[SSN\], dates of birth \[DOB\], etc.) is fictitious and is used solely for the purpose of illustrating lesson topics.

Formatting Conventions

Several formatting methods are used to highlight different aspects of this tutorial:

- "Snapshots" of computer online displays (i.e., roll-and-scroll screen captures/dialogues) and computer source code are shown in a non-proportional font.
- User's responses to online prompts will be boldface.
- Boldface type is also used to highlight a descriptive word or sentence.
- The Enter (or Return) key is illustrated by the symbol \<Enter\> when displayed in computer dialogue and is included in examples only when it may be unclear to the reader that such a keystroke must be entered.
- All uppercase is reserved for the representation of M code, and field and file names (e.g., the SSN field).

This manual uses several methods to highlight different aspects of the material:

- Various terms are used throughout the documentation to alert the reader to special information. The following table gives a description of each:

Presentation Structure

Environment Setup

The exercises in this tutorial make use of a simple test file referred to as *ZZINDIVIDUAL* that contains some sample datA. The A6AKIT set of routines can be used to install this test file on an M (MUMPS) system. Environment Setup contains information on how to obtain the A6AKIT routines. Lesson 1, Exercise 1.1. Create Your Test File shows you how to run the A6AKIT routine to install the test file.

Introduction

The tutorial introduction contains an overview of some of the basic key and index concepts.

Tutorial Lessons

Each section of this tutorial (Parts 1 through 3, shown below) contains topics and subsequent lessons. The information is presented in the following topic categories:

> 1. Part 1 - Regular Indexes includes the following five lessons. A brief description is given for each.

- Lesson 1 - You will create a New-style compound index based on the date of birth (DOB) and Social Security Number (SSN) fields in your *ZZINDIVIDUAL* test file.
- Lesson 2 - You will print the definition of your New-style compound index to view the data.
- Lesson 3 - You will see how your lookup index affects the behavior of the lookup utility IX^DIC. You will also change the collation and lookup prompt for the DOB field in your "C" index.
- Lesson 4 - You will use the transform properties located in ScreenMan to perform transforms on subscripts.
- Lesson 5 - You will create a whole-file index based on the fields in the EMAIL multiple of the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* test file. You will also illustrate a use for computed cross-reference values.

> 2. Part 2 - MUMPS Indexes includes the following three lessons. A brief description is given for each.

- Lesson 6 - You will learn about New-style MUMPS cross-references. It covers two topics: (1) the X, X1, and X2 arrays and (2) the set and kill logic and conditions of cross-references. You will create a New-style MUMPS cross-reference. Afterwards, you will check the behavior of your MUMPS cross-reference.
- Lesson 7 - You will learn when VA FileMan executes the set and kill logic of New-style cross-references. You will also create a MUMPS cross-reference that makes use of the VA FileMan X, X1, and X2 arrays and test your new MUMPS cross-reference.
- Lesson 8 - You will use the ACTIVITY property to suppress cross-reference execution.

> 3. Part 3 - Keys includes the following three lessons. A brief description is given for each.

- Lesson 9 - This lesson covers (1) Key Integrity, (2) the Uniqueness Index, and (3) Primary and Secondary Keys. You will create a key on the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file.
- Lesson 10 - You will print the definition of the key you created in Lesson 9 on the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file with key fields NAME field (#.01) and SSN field (#.02). You will look at the Uniqueness Index automatically created and explore different methods for defining the fields in the key.
- Lesson 11 - You will see examples of how VA FileMan enforces the integrity of the key you created in Lesson 9, and worked with in Lesson 10.

Conventions for Displaying TEST Data in this Document are as Follows:

- The first three digits (prefix) of any Social Security Numbers (SSN) will begin with either "666" or "666".
- Patient and user names will be formatted as follows: \[Application Name\]PATIENT,\[N\] and \[Application Name\]USER,\[N\] respectively, where "Application Name" is defined in the Approved Application Abbreviations document, located on the \[web site\] and where "N" represents the first name as a number spelled out and incremented with each new entry. For example, in FileMan, test patient and user names would be documented as follows: FMPATIENT,ONE; FMPATIENT,TWO; FMPATIENT,10; etC. and FMUSER,ONE; FMUSER,TWO; FMUSER,10; etC.

VA FileMan Version 22.0 introduced Key and Index functionality, which provides V*IST*A application developers the tools to design and develop more robust, efficient, and maintainable code and files. Native support for keys and complex indexes means developers no longer need to simulate these structures with M code.
With this hands-on tutorial, you will learn how you can take advantage of these powerful new tools. The instructions in the tutorial will guide you in creating your own keys and indexes on a test file set up via the A6AKIT set of routines. (See the Environment Setup page for information on how to obtain the A6AKIT routines.)
First, some definitions…
What is a Key?
A key is a set of one or more fields in a file that together uniquely identifies a record in that file. If you define a key, VA FileMan V. 22.0 automatically enforces the integrity of that key.
Key integrity means:
> 1\. No key field is null.
> 2\. The key (that is, the combination of fields in a key) is unique for all records in the file.
What is an Index?
An index is a sorted list of field values or associated data that "point" to a particular record in a file. It can be used to sort data and to look up a record via the indexed value, instead of searching the file sequentially.
In an index, VA FileMan stores the index name, the data value or values, and the internal entry number (IEN) of the record, each in its own subscript. To create an index in VA FileMan, you define a cross-reference of a given type.
What is a Cross-Reference?
A cross-reference identifies an action that should take place when the value of a field or fields defined in that cross-reference are changed. Often, the action is the placement of the value(s) into an index, in this case, the terms index and cross-reference are often used interchangeably. Technically speaking though, an index is a sorted list of records, and is built and maintained by defining a cross-reference(s).
Cross-references in Version 22 of VA FileMan can be divided into two broad categories: Traditional and New-style. Traditional cross-references are those cross-references you were able to create in versions of VA FileMan prior to Version 22, and can still create in Version 22. The new kind of cross-references you can create in Version 22 are called New-style cross-references.
What are Traditional Cross-References?
There are seven types of Traditional cross-references:
> 1\. Regular (index)
> 2\. Soundex (index)
> 3\. KWIC (index)
> 4\. Mnemonic (index)
> 5\. MUMPS (index or action)
> 6\. Trigger (action)
> 7\. Bulletin (action)
The first four define indexes, while the last two define actions that should be performed when the field on which the cross-reference is defined is edited. A MUMPS cross-reference may set an index or perform an action, depending on how it's defined.
A Traditional cross-reference is defined on a single field, and its definition is stored under ^DD(file#,field#,1). In general, the logic for a Traditional cross-reference is executed when the field on which it's defined is edited.
What is a New-Style Cross-Reference?
There are two types of New-style cross-references:
> 1\. Regular (index)
> 2\. MUMPS (index or action)
A New-style cross-reference can be composed of one or more fields. Its definition is stored in the INDEX file (#.11), which has the global root ^DD("IX").
New-style cross-references that are composed of a single field are called simple cross-references, and by default have field-level execution, which means that the cross-reference logic is executed immediately after the field is edited.
New-style cross-references that are composed of more than one field are called compound cross-references, and by default have record-level execution. Record-level execution means that the cross-reference logic is executed only after an entire record is edited, after all the fields in the cross-reference have been edited.

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Lesson 1. Create a Compound Index

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this lesson you will learn how to create a <span id="bk4_New_style" class="anchor"></span>[New-style](\l) Regular index. . The index you will create is a <span id="bk5_compound_index" class="anchor"></span>[compound index](\l), one that contains as subscripts data from two different fields.

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/005.png) | The only way you could have created a two-field compound index prior to Version 22.0 was to create two MUMPS cross-references, one on each field in the index. With Version 22.0, you can define the compound index as a single New-style Regular index. |

There are only two types of New-style cross-references, Regular and MUMPS, but they are much more powerful than their <span id="bk6_Traditional_cross_reference" class="anchor"></span>[Traditional cross-reference](\l) counterparts. In fact, most of the indexes you previously had to define as Traditional MUMPS cross-references can, with Version 22.0, be defined as New-style Regular indexes.

#### Exercise 1.1. Create Your Test File

The exercises in this tutorial make use of a simple test file that contains some sample data. In this exercise, you will use the A6AKIT routine to install your own personal copy of the test file. (See the Environment Setup page for information on how to obtain the A6AKIT set of routines.)

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/006.png) | In this tutorial, all references to the tutorial test file will be of file name *ZZINDIVIDUAL*, file number \#*662nnn*, and global root ^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,; however, you should always work with your own personal copy of the test file. |

Steps to Install the Test FileStep 1. Enter the following in programmer mode:

> \>D ^A6AKIT  

> I am going to set up a test file for the FileMan V. 22.0 Key and Index Tutorial.

End of Exercise 1.1.

#### Exercise 1.2. Create Your First Compound Index

In this exercise, you will create a New-style compound index based on the DOB and SSN fields in your <span id="bk7_ZZINDIVIDUAL" class="anchor"></span>[*ZZINDIVIDUAL*](\l) test file.

Step 1. First, follow the menu path to the VA FileMan option Cross Reference a Field or File:

> VA FileMan  
> Utility Functions  
> Cross Reference a Field or File

Step 2. Enter N for New at the prompt:

> What type of cross-reference (Traditional or New)? Traditional//NStep 3. Next, you are asked for the name of the file on which to create your cross-reference. Select the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* test file. Press Enter when prompted to select a subfile. Answer YES when asked if you want to create a new index on this file.

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>  
> Select Subfile: \<Enter\>

> There are no INDEX file cross-references defined on file \#*662*nnn. Want to create a new Index for this file? No// YESStep 4. Next, you are asked for the type of index you want to create. Press Enter to select the default index type REGULAR:

> Type of index: REGULAR// \<Enter\>

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/009.png) | You can create two types of New-style cross-references: Regular and MUMPS. MUMPS cross-references are discussed in Part 2 of this tutorial. |

Step 5. You are now asked if you want your index to be used for <span id="bk9_Lookup_and_Sorting" class="anchor"></span>[Lookup and Sorting](\l), or Sorting Only. Press Enter to select Lookup and Sorting:

> Want index to be used for Lookup & Sorting  
> or Sorting Only: LOOKUP & SORTING// \<Enter\>Step 6. Press Enter at the prompt to accept "C" as the <span id="bk10_index_name" class="anchor"></span>[index name](\l):

> Index Name: C// \<Enter\>Step 7. On the two-page <span id="bk10_ScreenMan" class="anchor"></span>[ScreenMan](\l) form you can edit the properties of the index you are creating. The first page shows you the responses to the questions you have already answered (i.e., the results of Steps 1 through 6).  
  
The only field you must fill in here is the Short Description. Tab to the Short Description field and enter the following:  
  
This is a regular index on the DOB and SSN fields.

> Number: *nnn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 1 of 2

> File: *662nnn* Root File: *662nnn*

> Index Name: C Root Type: INDEX FILE

> Short Description: This is a regular index on the DOB and SSN fields.

> Description (wp): (empty)

> Type: REGULAR

> Activity: IR

> Execution: FIELD

> Use: LOOKUP & SORTING

> Exit Save Next Page Refresh

> Enter a command or '^' followed by a caption to jump to a specific

> field.

<td><strong>Tips:</strong> <strong>&lt;CTRL-U&gt;</strong> is a toggle between the values: null, last edited, and the default of the ScreenMan field you are editing.<br />
<br />
Press <strong>&lt;PF1&gt;Z</strong> ("zoom") at any field to open up an editing window at the bottom of the screen. This editing window is often easier to use than the usual scrolling window, especially when the value of the field is very long, as is the case with the Set Logic.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Step 8. Page 2 of the ScreenMan form is used to enter field datA. Press \<PF1\>\<Down\> or \<PageDown\> to go to page 2. Here you will specify the fields in your compound index.  
  
In the "<span id="bk11_Order" class="anchor"></span>[Order...](\l)" column, type in the number 1 and press Enter:

> Number: *nn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 2 of 2

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES:

> Order... Subscr Type Length Field or Computed Expression

Step 9. Tab or arrow to the "CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE:" prompt, enter "F" for FIELD:  
  
CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE: F \<Enter\>  
  
This will bring up the pop-up window "Field-Type Cross Reference Value", shown in the next step.

|                                                                                                                |                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/011.png) | Each cross-reference value can be a field or a computed value. |

Step 10. At the "Field:" prompt in the pop-up window, enter DOB and press Enter:

> Number: *nn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 2 of 2

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES:

> Order... Subscr Type Length Field or Computed Expression

> -------- ------ ---- ------ ------------------------------

> Field-Type Cross Reference Value

> Order Number: 1 Subscript Number: 1

Step 11. Press \<PF1\>E to close the pop-up window.

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/012.png) | VA FileMan has automatically built the Set and Kill logic for your new cross-reference based on the DOB cross-reference value you added to the index. |

Step 12. Tab to the second row of the table, type the number 2 in the "Order…" column and press Enter.

Step 13. At the "CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE:" prompt, enter "F" for FIELD.

Step 14. At the "Field:" prompt on the pop-up window, enter SSN and press \<PF1\>E or \<PF1\>C to close the "Field-Type Cross Reference Value" pop-up window.  
  
At this point we have entered the second and last field (SSN) of our two field compound index.  
  
After you've added these two cross-reference values, page 2 should look like this:

> Number: *nnn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 2 of 2

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES:

> Order... Subscr Type Length Field or Computed Expression

> -------- ------ ---- ------ ------------------------------

> 1 1 FIELD DOB (#.03)

> 2 2 FIELD 30 SSN (#.02)

>  Set Logic: S ^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,"C",X(1),\$E(X(2),1,30),DA)=""

> Kill Logic: K ^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,"C",X(1),\$E(X(2),1,30),DA)

> Whole Kill: K ^DIZ(*662nnn*,"C")

> Set Condition:

> Kill Condition:

> COMMAND: Press \<PF1\>H for help Insert

> Your index contains two fields, DOB and SSN, each of which is used as a subscript in your index. Notice above that the Set and Kill Logic is automatically generated for you. X(1) refers to your DOB field, and X(2) refers to your SSN field. The subscripts 1 and 2 in the X array correspond to the Order numbers of the cross-reference values.

Step 15. Press \<PF1\>E to exit the ScreenMan form.

Step 16. Press Enter at the prompt "Do you want to build the index now? YES//". This will build the new "C" index on your file.

Congratulations! You have just created your first New-Style cross-reference!

### Lesson 2. Print the Definition of Your New Index to View Data

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan provides several data dictionary listing formats to view the definition of a file. In Version 22, the <span id="bk12a_Standard" class="anchor"></span>[Standard data dictionary](\l) listing has been modified to display New-style indexes. In addition, a new <span id="bk12b_Indexes_Only" class="anchor"></span>[Indexes Only](\l) type of listing displays only the cross-references, both new and Traditional, as they are defined on a file.

#### Exercise 2.1. See the New-Style Index You Created in Lesson 1

Step 1. First, follow the menu path to the data dictionary listing option List File Attributes:

> VA FileMan  
> Data Dictionary  
> <span id="bk13_List_File_Attributes" class="anchor"></span> [List File Attributes](#_KEY_DEFINITION_OPTION)

Step 2. Select your *ZZINDIVIDUAL* test file:

> START WITH WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*

> GO TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select SUB-FILE: \<Enter\>

> Select LISTING FORMAT: STANDARD// ??

> Choose from:

> 1 STANDARD

> 2 BRIEF

> 3 CUSTOM-TAILORED

> 4 MODIFIED STANDARD

> 5 TEMPLATES ONLY

> 6 GLOBAL MAP

> 7 CONDENSED

> 8 INDEXES ONLY

> 9 KEYS ONLY

> Select LISTING FORMAT: STANDARD// INDEXES ONLY

> What type of cross-reference (Traditional or New)? Both// \<Enter\> BOTH

> Which field: ALL// \<Enter\>Step 3. At the "Device:" prompt, enter ;80;999 to display the report on your terminal:

> DEVICE: ;80;999\<Enter\>

> The following is a report of all the cross-references defined on the *ZZINDIVIDUAL*

> test file:

> INDEX AND CROSS-REFERENCE LIST -- FILE \#*662nnn* 09/07/00 PAGE 1

> [X(2)](\l):SSN (*662nnn*,.02) (Subscr 2) (Len 30) (forwards)

> Subfile \#*662nnn*.02

> Traditional Cross-References:

> B REGULAR

> Field: ALIAS (*662nnn*.02,.01)

> 1)= S ^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,DA(1),2,"B",\$E(X,1,30),DA)=""

> 2)= K ^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,DA(1),2,"B",\$E(X,1,30),DA)

#### How to Look at the Data in Your Index

From programmer mode, do a global listing and look at the data in the "C" index of the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file as shown below:

> \>D ^%G \<Enter\>

> Device: \<Enter\> Right margin: 80=\> \<Enter\>

> Global <span id="bk26_DIZ" class="anchor"></span>[^*DIZ*](\l)(*662nnn*,"C" \<Enter\>

> *DIZ*(*662nnn*,"C"

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2191031,666345678,9)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2320205,666443333,2)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2380409,666432123,10)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2450520,666567890,13)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2450520,"000221111",1)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2470522,666996666,12)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2480811,666678901,7)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2550602,666889999,6)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2590714,666776666,3)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2691123,666223333,4)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2700321,666765432,11)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2710227,666654321,5)=

> ^DIZ(662*nnn*,"C",2730926,666891234,8)=

> Global ^

As you can see, the first subscript after the index name "C" contains the data from the DOB field. The next subscript contains the data from the SSN field. The last subscript in the index is the internal entry number of the indexed record.  
  
Prior to Version 22, the only way to create an index such as this was to create two MUMPS cross-references, one on the DOB field, and one on the SSN field. In fact, New-style Regular indexes are so powerful, the only time you should need to create a MUMPS cross-reference is for a cross-reference that performs some action, rather than sets an index.

In this lesson you will see how your Regular index affects the behavior of the lookup utility IX^DIC. You will also change the collation and lookup prompt for the DOB field in your "C" index. The following topics are covered with exercises following each:

1.  Interactive Lookups Using Compound Indexes.
2.  Passing Lookup Values for Lookups Using Compound Indexes.
3.  Collation Property and Lookup Prompt Property.

#### Interactive Lookups Using Compound Indexes

When you use a compound index for an interactive lookup, FileMan prompts you for values for each of the subscripts in the index.

#### Exercise 3.1. Use the New-Style Index in an Interactive IX^DIC Call

In this lesson you will see how your lookup index affects the behavior of the lookup utility IX^DIC. You will also change the collation and lookup prompt for the DOB field in your "C" index.

Step 1. From programmer mode, set up the input variables and perform an IX^DIC call using the New-style "C" index. Afterward, enter two question marks (??) at the "Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* DOB:" prompt.

> \>S <span id="bk27_setup_DIC" class="anchor"></span>[DIC="^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,",DIC(0)="QEAZ",D="C"](\l)

> \>D <span id="bk28_IX_DIC" class="anchor"></span>[IX^DIC](\l)

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* DOB: ??

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/013.png) | In the listing above FileMan displays the values stored in the index, DOB and SSN, as well as the value of the NAME field (#.01). |

Step 2. At the "Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* DOB:" prompt enter 5/20/1945. Press Enter at the "SSN:" prompt, then press Enter again at the "CHOOSE 1-2:" prompt.

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* DOB: 5/20/1945

> SSN: \<Enter\>

> 1 MAY 20, 1945 666567890 FMPATIENT,THIRTEEN

> 2 MAY 20, 1945 000221111 FMPATIENT,ONE

> CHOOSE 1-2: \<Enter\>Step 3. At the "Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* DOB:" prompt enter 5/20/1945, then at the "SSN:" prompt enter 00022:

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* DOB: 5/20/1945  
> SSN: 00022  
> MAY 20, 1945 000221111 FMPATIENT,ONE

End of Exercise 3.1.

#### Passing Lookup Values for Lookups Using Compound Indexes

Suppose you want to perform a lookup on the "C" index, but pass the lookup values to IX^DIC, rather than prompt the user for the values. Normally, in this kind of non-interactive lookup, you would pass the lookup value in the variable X. But with a compound index, you might want to look up a record based on the values of more than one field. FileMan allows you to pass in multiple values via the X(*n*) array, where n corresponds to the *subscript* number in the index. You can set X(1) to the lookup value for the data in *subscript* 1 (after the index name), X(2) to the lookup value for the data in *subscript* 2, etC.

#### Exercise 3.2. Use the New-Style Index in a Non-Interactive IX^DIC Call

In this exercise, you will make a non-interactive call to IX^DIC, passing in the lookup values in the X(*subscript*\#) array.

Step 1. Set up the input variables for a non-interactive IX^DIC call using the "C" index:

> \>S DIC="^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,",DIC(0)="QZ",D="C"Step 2. Set the X array to the lookup values shown below, and perform an IX^DIC call:

> \>S X(1)="5/20/1945",X(2)=00022  
> \>D IX^DICStep 3. Enter <span id="bk29_ZWRITE" class="anchor"></span>[ZWRITE (ZW) Y](\l) at the programmer mode prompt to see the results of the lookup.

> \>ZW Y \<Enter\>  
> Y="1^FMPATIENT,ONE"

> Y(0)="FMPATIENT,ONE^000221111^2450520"

> Y(0,0)="FMPATIENT,ONE"

End of Exercise 3.2.

#### Collation Property

New-style indexes allow you to control the direction in which FileMan traverses an index when it displays entries to the user. This is done via the <span id="bk30_Collation" class="anchor"></span>[Collation](\l) property of cross-reference subscripts. Normally, you would display entries in ascending alphabetical order, and so the collation for most subscripts is <span id="bk31_forward" class="anchor"></span>[forward](\l). But if you would like FileMan to traverse a subscript in an index in reverse order, you could change the collation of the subscript to <span id="bk32_backward" class="anchor"></span>[backward](\l).

#### Lookup Prompt Property

The Lookup prompt property of cross-reference subscripts can also be changed so that interactive lookups will use that string, rather than the field Label, to prompt the user for a lookup value.

#### Exercise 3.3. Change Collation and Lookup Prompt for DOB in "C" Index

In this exercise, you will change the collation of the DOB subscript in our "C" index so that most recent DOBs are displayed first. You will also change the Lookup prompt to DATE OF BIRTH instead of DOB.

Step 1. Follow the menu path to the option Cross Reference a Field or File:

> VA FileMan  
> Utility Functions  
> Cross Reference a Field or File

Step 2. Select NEW for the type of cross-reference, then select your *ZZINDIVIDUAL* test file at the "MODIFY WHAT FILE:" prompt. Press Enter at the "Select Subfile:" prompt.

> What type of cross-reference (Traditional or New)? Traditional// NEW

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: // *ZZINDIVIDUAL*

> Select Subfile: \<Enter\>

> Current Indexes on file \#*662nnn*:

> *nnn* 'C' Index

> Choose E (Edit)/D (Delete)/C (Create): E \<Enter\>

> Which Index do you wish to edit? *nnn*// C \<Enter\>Step 3. Next, you are presented the ScreenMan form where you can edit the properties of your "C" index. Press \<PF1\>Down or \<PageDown\> to go to page 2.

Step 4. Press Enter on the number 1 in the "Order…" column to edit the properties of the cross-reference value with Order number 1, the DOB field. A pop-up page opens where you can edit the properties of the DOB cross-reference value. Tab to Collation and enter B for backwards and press Enter.

Step 5. Tab to the "Lookup Prompt:" field, enter: DATE OF BIRTH.

Step 6. Press \<PF1\>E to close the pop-up page. Press \<PF1\>E again to save changes and exit the form.

Step 7. From programmer mode, set up the input variables and perform an IX^DIC call using the "C" index. Afterward, enter two question marks (??) at the "Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* DATE OF BIRTH:" prompt.

> \>S DIC="^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,",DIC(0)="QEAZ",D="C"  
> \>D IX^DIC

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* DATE OF BIRTH: ??  

> Choose from:  
> SEP 26, 1973 666891234 FMPATIENT,EIGHT

> FEB 27, 1971 666654321 FMPATIENT,FIVE

### Lesson 4. Transforms on Subscripts

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this lesson you will learn about the three different transforms you can define on cross-reference values, and how they can help make your indexes more usable.

Three Types of Transforms for Cross-Reference Values

These are the three types of transforms you can perform in VA FileMan on cross-reference values used as subscripts in an index:

> 1. Transform for Storage: You can use Transform for Storage to transform the internal value of the field before it is stored as a subscript in the index. In the exercises in this lesson, you will create a New-style Regular "D" index on the SSN field and use the Transform for Storage to append a space to the end of the SSN before it's stored in the index. This will make all SSNs noncanonic, so that they will all sort in the ASCII collation sequence.

> 2. Transform for Lookup: When VA FileMan uses an index in a lookup, it first looks up the value exactly as it was input. If it can't find the lookup value as it was originally input in the index, it performs some basic transformations on the value, as shown below:

- Converts the lookup value to all uppercase,
- Truncates long input to the maximum subscript length,
- Performs comma-piecing, or
- Converts values to internal form for the following fields: date, set of codes, pointer, and variable pointers.

> Once this conversion has taken place, VA FileMan tries the lookup again - but this time, looking for the transformed value.

> With New-style indexes, you can define your own transform that VA FileMan will perform in addition to its usual transforms. In Exercise 4.2 of this lesson, you will use the Transform for Lookup in your "D" index to strip out any hyphens from the SSN entered by the user. For example, if the user enters "123-45-6789" VA FileMan would strip the hyphens and also look for 666456789 in the index.

> 3. Transform for Display: If a subscript in the index has a Transform for Storage, you would probably also want to define a Transform for Display that takes the value as it is stored in the index and converts it back into a form that can be displayed to the user. In Exercise 4.2 of this lesson, you will use the Transform For Display property to take the space out of the SSN. (This is not really necessary in our case, since the extra space displayed at the end of the SSN wouldn't confuse the user. However, we'll strip it anyway for illustration purposes.)

The Transform properties are located in the "Field-Type Cross Reference Value" pop-up window, shown in the next screen capture.

> Number: *nn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 2 of 2

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES:

> Order... Subscr Type Length Field or Computed Expression

> -------- ------ ---- ------ ------------------------------

> Field-Type Cross Reference Value

> Order Number: *nn* Subscript Number: *nn*

> Field: *nn* File: *nnn*

> Field Name: SSN

> Maximum Length: Collation: forwards

> Lookup Prompt:

> Transform for Storage:

> Transform for Lookup:

> Transform for Display:

> COMMAND: Press \<PF1\>H for help Insert

#### Exercise 4.1. Create a New-Style Regular "D" Index on the SSN Field

To illustrate how and why you might use these transforms, you will create another New-style index, this time using the SSN field as the cross-reference value.

Step 1. Create a New-style Regular "D" index on the SSN field. Here's an abbreviated procedure for doing this:

> 1\. Select UTILITY FUNCTIONS and CROSS-REFERENCE A FIELD OR FILE on the VA FileMan menu.

> 2\. Select NEW for type of cross-reference.

> 3\. Select the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file.

> 4\. Choose C to create a new index.

> 5\. Enter REGULAR for type of index.

> 6\. Enter LOOKUP & SORTING for how the index should be used.

> 7\. Enter D for the index name.

> 8\. On page 1 of the ScreenMan form, at the "Short Description:" field enter A simple index on the SSN field.

> 9\. On page 2, in the "Order..." column type 1 and press Enter.

> 10\. For "Cross-Reference Values Type of Value," enter FIELD.

> 11\. In the pop-up window, for Field, enter SSN.

> 12\. Press \<PF1\>E twice and press Enter until you return to programmer mode.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/014.png) | Refer to Lesson 1, "Exercise 1.1. Create Your First Compound Index" for more information on creating a New-style Regular index on a field. However, don't forget to use these values. |

> The resulting Set and Kill Logic should look like this:

> Set Logic: S ^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,"D",\$E(X,1,30),DA)=""

> Kill Logic: K ^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,"D",\$E(X,1,30),DA)

> Whole Kill: K ^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,"D")

Step 2. This step and the next will illustrate two problems with the "D" index that you just created. The first is that the SSNs aren't sorted the way that you would expect. The second is that SSNs entered with hyphens are rejected.

> From programmer mode, set up the input variables using the "D" index and perform an IX^DIC call. Afterward, enter two question marks (??) at the "Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* SSN:" prompt to see a list of records in your test file as they are currently sorted in the "D" index.

End of Exercise 4.1.

#### Exercise 4.2. Modify the "D" Index to Include Transforms on the SSN Subscript

In this exercise you will modify the "D" index created in Exercise 4.1 so that:

> 1\. The list of SSNs displayed on ?? is sorted as you would expect, regardless of whether the SSN is canonic or noncanonic.

> 2\. Input of SSNs with hyphens (-) is accepted.

To do this you will use the three Transform properties of cross-reference values:

> 1\. The Transform for Storage to force each SSN stored in the index to be noncanonic by appending a space at the end.

> 2\. The Transform for Lookup to remove hyphens (-) from the lookup value.

> 3\. The Transform for Display to remove the space at the end of the SSN.

Step 1. Edit the "D" index, and on page 2 of the ScreenMan form, press Enter in the "Order…" column for Order number 1 to select the SSN cross-reference value.

Step 2. In the pop-up window, Tab to the "<span id="bk34_Transform_for_Storage" class="anchor"></span>[Transform for Storage](\l)" and enter the following M code:

> S X=X\_" "

> (This concatenates a space at the end of each SSN.)

Step 3. At the "<span id="bk35_Transform_for_Lookup" class="anchor"></span>[Transform for Lookup](\l)", enter the following M code:

> S X=\$TR(X,"-")

> (This removes all hyphens from any SSN entered by the user.)

Step 4. At the "<span id="bk36_Transform_for_Display" class="anchor"></span>[Transform for Display](\l)", enter the following M code:

> S:\$E(X,\$L(X))=" " X=\$E(X,1,\$L(X)-1)

> (This removes the space, previously concatenated in Step 2, at the end when displaying the SSN.)

Step 5. Press \<PF1\>E to close the pop-up window. Press \<PF1\>E again to save changes and exit the form. Answer YES to the following two questions:

> Do you want to delete the data in the old index now? YES// \<Enter\>

> Removing old index ... DONE!

> Do you want to build the index now? YES// \<Enter\>

> Building new index ... DONE!

### Lesson 5. Whole-File Indexes

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this lesson you will create a whole-file index based on the fields in the EMAIL multiple of the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* test file. This lesson will also illustrate a use for computed cross-reference values.

#### Exercise 5.1. Create a Whole-File Index Based on EMAIL NAME and EMAIL DOMAIN

In this exercise you will create a whole-file index that contains one computed subscript based on the EMAIL NAME and the EMAIL DOMAIN fields within the EMAIL multiple. The subscript in the index will look like:

email_name@email_domain

Step 1. First, follow the menu path to the option Cross Reference a Field or File as shown below:

> VA FileMan  
> Utility Functions  
> Cross Reference a Field or File

Step 2. Enter N for New at the prompt:

> What type of cross-reference (Traditional or New)? Traditional//NStep 3. Select the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file and EMAIL subfile. Answer yes when prompted if you want to create a new Index.

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>  
> Select Subfile: EMAIL \<Enter\> (Subfile \#*662nnn*.02)  

> There are no INDEX file cross-references defined on subfile \#*662nnn*.02. Want to create a new Index for this file? No// Y \<Enter\> YES

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/018.png) | The fields you will select as cross-reference values in our index will be fields in the EMAIL subfile. |

Step 4. For type of index, enter: REGULAR.

> Type of index: REGULAR// \<Enter\> REGULAR

Step 5. Because you selected a subfile (the EMAIL multiple), VA FileMan asks you whether you want to index the whole ZINDIVIDUAL file. Press Enter to select the default YES.

> Want to <span id="bk38_index_whole_file" class="anchor"></span>[index whole file](\l) *ZZINDIVIDUAL* (#*662nnn*)? Yes// \<Enter\> YES

Step 6. When asked how the index should be used, select SORTING ONLY:

> Want index to be used for Lookup & Sorting

> or <span id="bk40_Sorting_Only" class="anchor"></span>[Sorting Only](\l): LOOKUP & SORTING// SORTING ONLY

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/019.png) | You want VA FileMan to use this index for lookup only if you explicitly specify the index in the call. If you choose LOOKUP & SORTING here, VA FileMan would automatically use this index whenever you passed the <span id="bk41_M_flag" class="anchor"></span>["M" flag](\l) to a lookup API. |

Step 7. For Index name select the default AC.

> Index Name: AC// \<Enter\> AC

Step 8. You are now presented with the two-page ScreenMan form for editing the properties of your index. On the first page, enter the following as the Short Description:

> This is a whole-file index with the computed subscript email name@email domain.

> Number: *nnn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 1 of 2

> <span id="bk42_File" class="anchor"></span>[File](\l): *662nnn* <span id="bk43_Root_File" class="anchor"></span>[Root File](\l): *662nnn*.02

Step 9. Press \<PF1\>\<Down\> or \<PageDown\> to go to page 2 of the ScreenMan form.

Step 10. Create two cross-reference values of type FIELD. Define the first as the EMAIL NAME field (#.01), and the second as the EMAIL DOMAIN field (#1) as shown below:

> Number: *nnn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 2 of 2

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES:

> Order... <span id="bk45_Subscr" class="anchor"></span>[Subscr](\l) Type Length Field or Computed Expression

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/021.png) | These two fields (EMAIL NAME and EMAIL DOMAIN) will not be used as subscripts in our index. Instead, you will create a single subscript based on those two fields. |

Step 11. Tab to the "Subscr" column in the ScreenMan form, page 2, and delete the values 1 and 2.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 8%" />
<col style="width: 91%" />

Step 12. Tab to the next column labeled "Order…" on the third row of the table, type in the number 3 and press Enter.

Step 13. At the "CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE:" prompt enter "C" for COMPUTED.

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE: C \<Enter\>Step 14. Enter 1 as the subscript number.

Step 17. Delete all the values in the "Length" column. Both EMAIL NAME and EMAIL DOMAIN are free text fields from 1 to 20 characters in length. Our computed subscript, EMAIL NAME@EMAIL DOMAIN should therefore never exceed 41 characters (1 to 20 for each field combined and 1 for the "@" sign) in length, well within the limits of the M portability standards.

# Part 2. [MUMPS Cross-References](\l)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

VA FileMan Version 22.0 allows you to create two types of New-style cross-references: Regular and MUMPS. As you have seen in previous lessons, Regular cross-references build indexes that can be used to lookup and/or sort entries in a file.

The advanced capabilities of Regular cross-references, which include the ability to define compound indexes, computed subscripts, and subscript transforms, means that most of the indexes you previously had to define as Traditional MUMPS cross-references can, with Version 22.0, be defined as New-style Regular indexes. You can usually reserve MUMPS cross-references for performing actions other than building indexes.

### Lesson 6. Create a New-Style MUMPS Cross-Reference

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This lesson introduces you to New-style MUMPS cross-references. It covers two topics:

> 1\. The X, X1, and X2 arrays.

> 2\. The set and kill logic and conditions of cross-references.

#### The X, X1, and X2 Arrays

The <span id="bk49_set_and_kill_logic" class="anchor"></span>[set and kill logic](\l) and the set and Kill Conditions of New-style cross-references can reference the X, X1, and X2 arrays. Here is what those arrays contain when a record is edited, and the cross-reference is fired:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 16%" />
<col style="width: 83%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>X(order#)</td>
<td><p>Contains the <strong>old</strong> cross reference values when the kill logic and Kill Condition are executed.</p>
<p>Contains the <strong>new</strong> cross reference values when the Set Logic and Set Condition are executed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>X1(order#)</td>
<td>Contains the <strong>old</strong> cross reference values when the set and kill logic and conditions are executed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>X2(order#)</td>
<td>Contains the <strong>new</strong> cross reference values when the set and kill logic and conditions are executed.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When a new record is added to a file, VA FileMan sets the .01 field and immediately fires the Set Logic of all the cross-references on the .01 field. If a New-style cross-reference contains the .01 field as a cross-reference value, the X1(order#) array element that corresponds to the .01 field is guaranteed to be null at this point.

When a record is deleted from a file, the kill logic of all cross-references for that record is executed. All X2(order#) array elements are null at this point.

#### Set and Kill Condition

You can define Set and Kill Conditions on both Regular and MUMPS cross-references to prevent a cross-reference from firing under conditions you specify.

If there is a Set Condition, the Set Logic will be executed only if the Set Condition sets X to Boolean true (that is, after the Set Condition code is executed, the command IF X evaluates to true). Similarly, if there is Kill Condition, the Kill Logic is executed only if the Kill Condition sets X to Boolean true.

Typically, your Set and Kill Conditions would check the X, X1 and/or X2 arrays to decide whether the Set and Kill Logic should be executed.

#### Exercise 6.1. Create Your First New-Style MUMPS Cross-Reference

In this exercise, you will create a MUMPS cross-reference that should be executed only when a new record is added to the file. To do this you will add the .01 field as the only cross-reference value in the cross-reference, make it order number 1, and include a Set Condition that sets X to 1 only if X1(1) is null. The Set Logic itself will update the DATE CREATED field with the current date and time.

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Cross Reference a Field or File option to create a MUMPS cross-reference named "AD".

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/024.png) | Because you are defining a MUMPS cross-reference, FileMan assumes your cross-reference value will not be used as a subscript, and so doesn't automatically assign it a subscript number. Since most of the time, cross-references that set an index can be defined as Regular indexes, most MUMPS cross-references don't have values that are used as subscripts in an index. If your MUMPS cross-reference has cross-reference values that are used as subscripts, you must manually enter subscript numbers for them. |

Also, X1(1) would evaluate to true (1) for every existing entry, since all entries have non-null .01 field values, so the Set Logic wouldn't get executed anyway. |

End of Exercise 6.1.

#### Exercise 6.2. Test the New MUMPS Cross-Reference

In this exercise, you will check the behavior of the new MUMPS cross-reference you created in Exercise 6.1. To do this, you will add a record to the file and make sure the DATE CREATED field is correctly updated with the current date and time. You will then edit the .01 field of an existing record to make sure the DATE CREATED field is not updated.

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Enter or Edit File Entries option to add a new record 'NEW,ENTRY' to the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file:

> Select OPTION NAME: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

> INPUT TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// .01 NAME

> THEN EDIT FIELD: \<Enter\>

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: NEW,ENTRY

> Are you adding 'NEW,ENTRY' as a new *ZZINDIVIDUAL* (the 14TH)? No// Y (Yes)

Step 2. Use VA FileMan's Inquire to File Entries to look at the 'NEW,ENTRY' record you just added:

> Select OPTION NAME: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES

> OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: \<space\>\<Enter\> NEW,ENTRY

> ANOTHER ONE: \<Enter\>

> STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// \<Enter\> (Yes)

> Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// \<Enter\> - No record number (IEN), no

> Computed Fields

> NAME: NEW,ENTRY DATE CREATED: FEB 21,2001@10:42:27

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/029.png) | The MUMPS cross-reference stuffed the current date and time into the DATE CREATED field. |

Step 3. Use VA FileMan's Enter or Edit File Entries option to edit the NAME field of our 'NEW,ENTRY' record to 'MODIFIED,ENTRY':

> Select OPTION NAME: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

> INPUT TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// NAME

> THEN EDIT FIELD: \<Enter\>

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: \<space\>\<Enter\> NEW,ENTRY

> NAME: NEW,ENTRY// MODIFIED,ENTRYStep 4. Use VA FileMan's Inquire to File Entries again to see if the DATE CREATED field has changed:

> Select OPTION NAME: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES

> OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: \<space\>\<Enter\> MODIFIED,ENTRY

> ANOTHER ONE: \<Enter\>

> STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// \<Enter\> (Yes)

> Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// \<Enter\> - No record number (IEN), no

> Computed Fields

> NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY DATE CREATED: FEB 21,2001@10:42:27

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/030.png) | The date and time stored in the DATE CREATED field has not changed, even though the value of the .01 field was changed. Our Set Condition prevented the Set Logic from executing since during the edit, the values of the .01 field and the corresponding X1(1) array element are not null. |

[Go Back](#bk_lesson6_q1)

Question 2: The Set and Kill logic and the Set and Kill conditions of New-style cross-references can reference the X, X1, and X2 arrays. What does the X(order#) array contain when a record is edited, and the cross-reference is fired?

Answer: C. "Both of the above." (The X(order#) array contains \[1\] the old cross-reference values when the Kill Logic and Kill Condition are executed, and \[2\] the new cross-reference values when the Set Logic and Set Condition are executed.)

[Go Back](#bk_lesson6_q2)

Question 3: What does the X1(order#) array contain when a record is edited, and the cross-reference is fired?

Answer: A. "The old cross-reference values when the Set and Kill logic and conditions are executed."

[Go Back](#bk_lesson6_q3)

Question 4: What does the X2(order#) array contain when a record is edited, and the cross-reference is fired?

Answer: B. "The new cross-reference values when the Set and Kill logic and conditions are executed."

[Go Back](#bk_lesson6_q4)

Question 5: When a new record is added to a file, FileMan sets the .01 field and immediately fires the Set logic of all the cross-references on the .01 field. The X1(order#) array element that corresponds to the .01 field is null at this point.

Answer: A. "True."

[Go Back](#bk_lesson6_q5)

Question 6: When a record is deleted from a file, the Kill logic of all cross-references for that record is executed. All X2(order#) array elements are null at this point.

Answer: A. "True."

[Go Back](#bk_lesson6_q6)

Question 7: You can define Set and Kill Conditions on both Regular and MUMPS cross-references to prevent a cross-reference from firing under conditions you specify. If there is a Set Condition, the Set Logic will be executed only if the Set Condition sets X to Boolean true (i.e., after the Set Condition code is executed, the command IF X evaluates to true).

Answer: A. "True."

[Go Back](#bk_lesson6_q7)

Question 8: If there is Kill Condition on a Regular and MUMPS cross-reference, the Kill Logic is executed only if the Kill Condition sets X to Boolean false.

Answer: B. "False." (The Kill Logic is executed only if the Kill Condition sets X to Boolean true.)

[Go Back](#bk_lesson6_q8)

Question 9: An Action-type cross-reference is a cross-reference with Set and Kill logic that performs some action other than building an index. Most MUMPS cross-references are Action-type cross-references. An Action-type cross-reference must have a name that starts with the letter:

Answer: A. "A".

### Lesson 7. Cross-Reference Execution

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this lesson you will learn when VA FileMan executes the Set and Kill Logic of New-style cross-references. You will also use the X1 and X2 arrays in the Set Logic of a MUMPS cross-reference.

#### When Does Cross-Reference Logic Get Executed?

In general, for New-style cross-references both Regular and MUMPS, when a field or group of fields defined in a New-style cross-reference is edited, both the Kill and the Set Logic of that cross-reference are executed. First, the Kill logic is executed with the X(order#) array set to the old (pre-edited) field values. Then the Set Logic is executed with the X(order#) array set to the new values.

The exceptions to this are as follows:

> 1. Null subscript values.

> If a cross-reference value is used as a subscript (that is, it has a subscript number), and the old value is null, the Kill logic is not executed. Similarly, the Set Logic is not executed if a new value used as a subscript is null.

> 2. Record deletion.

> When an entire record is deleted from a file, only the Kill Logic, not the Set Logic, is executed. The X2(order#) array elements, which normally contain the new cross-reference values, are all set to null.

> 3. Record creation.

> Immediately after a record is added to a file, only the Set Logic, not the Kill Logic, of New-style cross-references that contain the .01 field is executed. The X1(order#) array element that corresponds to the .01 field is set to null at this point.

> 4. Kill and Set Conditions.

> As illustrated in Lesson 6, if the Set or Kill Condition sets X to Boolean false, the Set or Kill Logic will not be executed.

The following table summarizes when the Kill and Set Logic are executed for New-style cross-references.

<sup>1</sup> only if no old values used as subscripts are null, and the Set Condition, if any, sets X to true (1).

<sup>2</sup> only if no new values used as subscripts are null, and the Kill Condition, if any, sets X to true (1).

Note that in "Record edit," it doesn't matter if individual field values are created (go from null to non-null) or deleted (go from non-null to null) - both the Kill and the Set Logic are executed as long as none of the field values used as subscripts evaluate to null.

This behavior is slightly different than that of Traditional cross-references. Since Traditional cross-references are defined on a specific field, the Kill and Set Logic are executed depending on whether that one field value is created, deleted, or edited.

The following table summarizes when the Kill and Set Logic are executed for Traditional cross-references.

#### Execution

The Execution property of New-style cross-references controls the timing of cross-reference execution. Execution can be either of the following:

> 1. Field execution means that the cross-reference logic is executed immediately after each and every field in the cross-reference is edited.

> 2. Record execution means that the cross-reference logic is executed once at the end of an editing session after all fields in the record are edited.

Usually, simple cross-references (those that have only one field-type cross-reference value) have Field-level execution. Compound cross-references (those that have more than one field-type cross-reference value) have Record-level execution.

#### Exercise 7.1. Create a MUMPS Cross-Reference that Makes Use of the X, X1, and X2 Arrays

In this exercise, you will create a MUMPS cross-reference that contains two field-type cross-reference values, AREA CODE field (#3.1) and LOCAL NUMBER field (#3.2). When either or both of those fields are updated, the OLD PHONE NUMBER field (#3.4) will be set to:

> (Old_Area_Code) Old_Local_Number

and the PHONE NUMBER field (#3.3) is set to:

> (New_Area_Code) New_Local_Number

In addition, if the old area code, new area code, old local number, or new local number is null, you will store the value as the string "null" in the OLD PHONE NUMBER and PHONE NUMBER fields. To accomplish this task, you will use computed cross-reference values.

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Cross Reference a Field or File option to create a MUMPS cross-reference named "AE":

> Select OPTION: UTILITY FUNCTIONS

> Select UTILITY OPTION: CROSS-REFERENCE A FIELD OR FILE

> What type of cross-reference (Traditional or New)? Traditional// NEW

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select Subfile: \<Enter\>

> Current Indexes on file \#*662nnn*:

> *nnn* 'C' index

> *nnn* 'D' index

> *nnn* 'AD' index

> Choose E (Edit)/D (Delete)/C (Create): CREATE

> Want to create a new Index for this file? No// YES

> Type of index: REGULAR// MUMPS

> How is this MUMPS cross reference to be used: ACTION// ACTION

> Index Name: AE// \<Enter\> AE

Step 2. On the first page of the ScreenMan form, enter the following Short Description:

> Update PHONE NUMBER & OLD PHONE NUMBER if AREA CODE & LOCAL NUMBER are edited.Step 3. Tab to Execution and enter R for RECORD.

> Number: *nnn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 1 of 2

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/031.png) | Our "AE" cross-reference will contain two fields, AREA CODE and LOCAL NUMBER, and so should have an execution value of Record. |

Step 4. On page 2 of the ScreenMan form, add the AREA CODE field as order number 1:

> Order...: 1

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE: FIELD

> Field: AREA CODEStep 5. Add the LOCAL NUMBER field as order number 2:

> Order...: 2

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE: FIELD

> Field: LOCAL NUMBER

> Page 2 of the ScreenMan form should now look like this:

> Number: *nn* EDIT AN INDEX Page 2 of 2

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES:

> COMMAND:                     Press \<\>PF1\>H for help     Insert

Step 6. Add a cross-reference value of type Computed that evaluates either to the AREA CODE field or to the string "null", if the AREA CODE field is missing.

> Order...: 3

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE: COMPUTED

> Computed Code: S X=\$S(X(1)="":"null",1:X(1))

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/032.png) | X(1) in the computed expression is the value of the AREA CODE field, the cross-reference value with order number 1. The computed expression sets the variable X to the AREA CODE (X(1)), or if the AREA CODE is null (X(1)=""), it sets X to the string "null". |

Step 7. Similarly, add a cross-reference value of type Computed that evaluates to the LOCAL NUMBER field, or, if the LOCAL NUMBER field is missing, the string "null."

> CROSS-REFERENCE VALUES TYPE OF VALUE: COMPUTED

> Computed Code: S X=\$S(X(2)="":"null",1:X(2))

This is not a problem, but we'll choose to have those fields updated only upon subsequent edits. |

End of Exercise 7.1.

#### Exercise 7.2. Test the New MUMPS Cross-Reference

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Enter or Edit File Entries to edit the AREA CODE field (#3.1) and the LOCAL NUMBER field (#3.2) of the MODIFIED,ENTRY record added in Lesson 6.

> Select OPTION NAME: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

> INPUT TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// 3.1 \<Enter\> AREA CODE

> THEN EDIT FIELD: 3.2 \<Enter\> LOCAL NUMBER

> THEN EDIT FIELD:

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY

> AREA CODE: 415

> LOCAL NUMBER: 555-1234Step 2. Use VA FileMan's Inquire to File Entries option to look at the data in the MODIFIED,ENTRY record.

> Select OPTION NAME: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES

> OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY

> ANOTHER ONE: \<Enter\>

> STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// \<Enter\> (Yes)

> Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// \<Enter\> - No record number (IEN), no Computed Fields

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/036.png) | The OLD PHONE NUMBER field is set to the previous phone number (area code and local phone were both null), and the PHONE NUMBER field is set to the new phone number (area code and local number). |

Step 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2, but this time delete the area code. At the end of this step, the field values should be:

> NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY LOCAL NUMBER: 555-1234

> PHONE NUMBER: (null) 555-1234 OLD PHONE NUMBER: (415) 555-1234

> DATE CREATED: \<Date/Time Created\>

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/037.png) | The PHONE NUMBER and OLD PHONE NUMBER fields again correctly reflect the original and new values of the AREA CODE and LOCAL NUMBER fields. |

Step 4. Repeat Steps 1 and 2, but this time enter 510 as the Area Code and delete the Local Number. At the end of this step, the field values should be:

> NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY AREA CODE: 510

> PHONE NUMBER: (510) null OLD PHONE NUMBER: (null) 555-1234

> DATE CREATED: \<Date/Time Created\>

Step 5. Repeat Steps 1 and 2, but this time enter 555-3412 as the Local Number. At the end of this step, the field values should be:

> NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY AREA CODE: 510

> LOCAL NUMBER: 555-3412 PHONE NUMBER: (510) 555-3412

> OLD PHONE NUMBER: (510) null DATE CREATED: \<Date/Time Created\>

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/038.png) | In all cases, Steps 1 through 5, the Set Logic was executed, even when the Area Code and/or the Local Number field values were deleted. |

### Lesson 8. Using ACTIVITY to Suppress Cross-Reference Execution

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this lesson you will learn about the Activity property of New-style cross-references.

#### Activity

Cross-references are executed when a record is re-indexed via one of the ^DIK entry points or when the Re-Index File option on the VA FileMan Utility Functions menu is selected. Also, during a Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) installation, if the KIDS Build sends a file with data, records in the file may be reindexed automatically.

The Activity cross-reference property allows you to prevent a particular cross-reference from firing during a re-indexing operation and/or a KIDS installation. By default, when you create a New-style cross-reference, Activity is automatically set to "IR". Activity does not control whether a cross-reference is fired when a record is added, edited, or deleted.

If you wish to suppress the firing of the cross-reference when VA FileMan's reindexing APIs (xxx^DIK) and when the Re-Index File option is called, you can remove the "R" from Activity.

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/039.png) | Note, however, that if you explicitly select a cross-reference in an EN^DIK, EN1^DIK, or ENALL^DIK call, or in the UTILITY FUNCTIONS/RE-INDEX FILE option on the VA FileMan menu, that cross-reference will be fired whether or not its Activity contains an "R". |

If you wish to suppress firing a cross-reference during a KIDS installation, you can remove the "I" from Activity.

#### Exercise 8.1. Reindex a Single Record with IX1^DIK

In this exercise, you will reindex the MODIFIED,ENTRY record via the IX1^DIK entry point. This causes the Set Logic of the "AE" cross-reference you created in Lesson 7 to be executed.

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Enter or Edit File Entries option to edit the AREA CODE field (#3.1) and the LOCAL NUMBER field (#3.2) of the MODIFIED,ENTRY record. First change the area code to 111 and the local number to 111-1111. Then change them again to 415 and 555-1234, respectively. This step simply establishes a starting point for the values of the fields OLD PHONE NUMBER and PHONE NUMBER.

> Select OPTION NAME: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

> INPUT TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// 3.1 \<Enter\> AREA CODE

> THEN EDIT FIELD: 3.2 \<Enter\> LOCAL NUMBER

> THEN EDIT FIELD:

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY

> AREA CODE: 111

> LOCAL NUMBER: 111-1111

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: \<space\>\<Enter\> MODIFIED,ENTRY

> AREA CODE: 111// 415

> LOCAL NUMBER: 111-1111// 555-1234Step 2. Use VA FileMan's Inquire to File Entries option to look at the values of OLD PHONE NUMBER and PHONE NUMBER. Select a <span id="bk64_STANDARD_CAPTIONED_OUTPUT" class="anchor"></span>[STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT](\l), and when asked whether to include COMPUTED fields, answer R to include the Record Number in the display.

> Select OPTION NAME: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES

> OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: \<space\>\<Enter\> MODIFIED,ENTRY

> ANOTHER ONE: \<Enter\>

> STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// \<Enter\> (Yes)

> Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// Record Number (IEN)

> NUMBER: 14 NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY

> AREA CODE: 415 LOCAL NUMBER: 555-1234

> PHONE NUMBER: (415) 555-1234 OLD PHONE NUMBER: (111) 111-1111

> DATE CREATED: \<Date/Time Created\>

Step 3. Use IX1^DIK to reindex the MODIFIED,ENTRY. Set DA to the record number displayed in Step 2.

> \>S <span id="bk65_set_DIK" class="anchor"></span>[DIK="^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,",DA=14](\l)

> \>D <span id="bk66_IX1_DIK" class="anchor"></span>[IX1^DIK](\l)

Step 4. Use VA FileMan's Inquire to File Entries option to see the effect of reindexing the entry.

> Select OPTION NAME: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES

> OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: \<space\>\<Enter\> MODIFIED,ENTRY

> ANOTHER ONE: \<Enter\>

> STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// \<Enter\> (Yes)

> Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// Record Number (IEN)

> NUMBER: 14 NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY

> AREA CODE: 415 LOCAL NUMBER: 555-1234

> PHONE NUMBER: (415) 555-1234 OLD PHONE NUMBER: (415) 555-1234

> DATE CREATED: \<Date/Time Created\>

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/040.png) | The reindexing call IX1^DIK caused the Set Logic of the MUMPS "AE" index you created in Lesson 7 to be executed. When an entry is reindexed, fields aren't being edited, and so the old field values in the X1 array and the new field values in the X2 array both equal the current field values. Hence, when the Set Logic of our "AE" cross-reference is executed, both the OLD PHONE NUMBER and PHONE NUMBER fields reflect the current values of the AREA CODE (#3.1) and LOCAL NUMBER (#3.2) fields. |

End of Exercise 8.1.

#### Exercise 8.2. See How Removing "R" from Activity Affects the IX1^DIK Call

In this exercise, you will remove the "R" from the Activity property of our "AE" cross-reference. This will cause the Set Logic of that cross-reference not to be executed when you reindex a record with IX1^DIK.

Step 1. Before you begin this exercise, you need to re-establish the starting point for the values of the fields PHONE NUMBER and OLD PHONE NUMBER. To do this, enter the following command from programmer mode:

> \>D MODENT^A6AKIT(*662nnn*)  

> Where *662nnn* is the number of your copy of the tutorial test file. This is equivalent to performing Steps 1 and 2 from exercise 8.1.

Step 2. Edit the "AE" MUMPS cross-reference:

> Select OPTION NAME: UTILITY FUNCTIONS

> Select UTILITY OPTION NAME: CROSS-REFERENCE A FIELD OR FILE

> What type of cross-reference (Traditional or New)? Traditional// NEW

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select Subfile: \<Enter\>

> Current Indexes on file \#*662nnn*:

> *nnn* 'C' index

> *nnn* 'D' index

> *nnn* 'AD' index

> *nnn* 'AE' index

> Choose E (Edit)/D (Delete)/C (Create): EDIT

> Which Index do you wish to edit? AE  \<Enter\>Step 3. On the first page of the ScreenMan, tab to the Activity field and remove the "R".

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/041.png) | You actually would probably also want to remove the "I" from Activity to suppress the firing of this cross-reference during a KIDS installation when data is sent with the file. |

Step 4. Press \<PF1\>E to exit (and save) the form.

Step 5. As in Step 3 of Exercise 1, make an IX1^DIK call to reindex the MODIFIED,ENTRY entry:

> \>S DIK="^*DIZ*(*662nnn*,",DA=14 D IX1^DIK

Step 6. Use VA FileMan's Inquire to File Entries option to see the effect of reindexing the entry.

> NUMBER: 14 NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY

> AREA CODE: 415 LOCAL NUMBER: 555-1234

> PHONE NUMBER: (415) 555-1234 OLD PHONE NUMBER: (111) 111-1111

> DATE CREATED: \<Date/Time Created\>

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/042.png) | The PHONE NUMBER and OLD PHONE NUMBER fields haven't been changed. The reindexing call IX1^DIK did not execute the "AE" MUMPS cross-reference because you removed the "R" from the Activity property of that cross-reference. |

End of Exercise 8.2.

# Part 3. [Keys](\l)

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Version 22 of VA FileMan allows you to define a database key on a file. A database key is a set of one or more fields that, when taken together, uniquely identifies a record in a file.

VA FileMan stores key definitions in the KEY file (#.31), under the global root ^DD("KEY").

### Lesson 9. Create a Key

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This lesson covers the following topics:

> 1\. Key Integrity

> 2\. Uniqueness Index

> 3\. Primary and Secondary Keys

In the exercise that follows, you will create a key on the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file.

#### Key Integrity

When you define a key, VA FileMan automatically enforces the integrity of that key. Key integrity means that:

> 1\. The key is unique for all records in a file.

2\. A field that is part of a key must have a value (i.e., it cannot be null).

#### Uniqueness Index

When you create a key in VA FileMan, an index, called the Uniqueness Index, is automatically created. This index contains as subscripts the fields in that key. The Uniqueness Index is simply a New-style Regular index that supports a key. VA FileMan uses the Uniqueness Index of a key to enforce the integrity of that key and to look up entries in the file based on the fields in the key.

For example, if you define a key and select NAME and SSN as the fields in that key, FileMan automatically creates a corresponding Uniqueness Index that contains as subscripts the NAME and SSN fields.

#### Primary and Secondary Keys

If a file has a key, exactly one key in that file must be designated the primary key. All other keys, if any, are secondary keys. VA FileMan enforces key integrity equally for both primary and secondary keys, but it uses the primary key as the principal means for looking up entries in a file. For example, in a ^DIC lookup, if the user enters a question mark (?) at the Select prompt, VA FileMan automatically displays the data in the primary key fields for each record listed.

|                                                                                                                |                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/043.png) | The .01 field should be defined as part of the primary key. |

#### Exercise 9.1. Create Your First Key

In this exercise you will define your first key on the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file. The fields in that key will be the NAME field (#.01) and the SSN field (#.02).

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Key Definition option to create a new key named "A":

> Select OPTION: UTILITY FUNCTIONS

> Select UTILITY OPTION: KEY DEFINITION

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select Subfile: \<Enter\>

> There are no Keys defined on file \#*662nnn*.

> Want to create a new Key for this file? No// YES

> Enter a Name for the new Key: A// \<Enter\> A

> Creating new Key 'A' ...

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/044.png) | Key names must be one uppercase letter. You should give the primary key of your file or subfile the name "A". Subsequent secondary keys should be given the names "B", "C", and so on. |

Step 2. You are now presented with a one-page ScreenMan form. Here you can select the fields in your new key.  
  
In the first row of the "KEY FIELDS" section, under the "Field" column, enter NAME (or .01). In the "Seq No." column, enter 1. In the second row of the "KEY FIELDS" section, enter SSN (or .02), and in the "Seq No." column, enter 2.  
  
The screen should now look like this:

> Number: *nn* EDIT A KEY Page 1 of 1

> File: *662nnn* Name: A <span id="bk69_Priority" class="anchor"></span>[Priority](\l): PRIMARY

> <span id="bk70_KEY_FIELDS" class="anchor"></span>[KEY FIELDS](\l):

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/045.png) | The sequence number corresponds to the subscript number of the cross-reference value as it will be stored in the Uniqueness Index. The first field of every key should be given a sequence number of 1, the second 2, and so on. |

Step 3. Press \<PF1\>E to exit the form.

Step 4. FileMan then indicates that it will create a Uniqueness Index to support the key you just created and prompts you for an index name. Select the default name "E".

> I'm going to create a new Uniqueness Index to support Key 'A'

> of File \#*662nnn*.

> Index Name: E// \<Enter\>

> One moment please ...

Step 5. If asked whether you want to build the new index, press Enter to select the default YES and press Enter again to continue.

Step 7. If any of the records in your file violate key integrity, you are presented with a list of options. A problem will probably be found. If so, select option 3 to ignore the problem for now. We know that we want to define the NAME and SSN fields as Key A. If any of the existing data in the file causes key integrity to be violated, we will correct it later.

Step 8. At this point, the key is successfully defined, and FileMan shows you the basic information about the key. At the list of options, choose VERIFY to determine which record(s) violated key integrity in Step 7.

Step 9. Select Key A, the key you just created, as the key to verify. Since our test file has only a few records in it, don't store the internal entry numbers of the records that violate key integrity in a template - just press Enter at the "STORE THESE ENTRY ID'S IN TEMPLATE:" prompt. Press Enter at the "DEVICE:" prompt to print the results to the screen.

### Lesson 10. Print Key Definition and View Uniqueness Index

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In Lesson 9, you created a primary key on the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file, with key fields NAME (#.01) and SSN (#.02). In this lesson, you will print the definition of the key and look at the Uniqueness Index automatically created. You will also explore different methods for defining the fields in the key.

#### The "Keys Only" Data Dictionary Listing

The standard data dictionary listing in Version 22 has been modified to display the keys defined on a file or subfile. In addition, a new Keys Only type of listing has been created to display only the keys defined on a file.

#### Exercise 10.1. Display the Key You Created in Lesson 9

In this exercise, you will use the Keys Only data dictionary listing to take a look at the key (Key A) you defined in Lesson 9. You will also look at the Uniqueness Index VA FileMan automatically created to support the key.

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's List File Attributes option to select the "Keys Only" listing format:

> Select OPTION: DATA DICTIONARY UTILITIES

> Select DATA DICTIONARY UTILITY OPTION: LIST FILE ATTRIBUTES

> START WITH WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*

> GO TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select SUB-FILE: \<Enter\>

> Select LISTING FORMAT: STANDARD// ??

> Choose from:

> 1 STANDARD

> 2 BRIEF

> 3 CUSTOM-TAILORED

> 4 MODIFIED STANDARD

> 5 TEMPLATES ONLY

> 6 GLOBAL MAP

> 7 CONDENSED

> 8 INDEXES ONLY

> 9 KEYS ONLY

> Select LISTING FORMAT: STANDARD// KEYS ONLY

> DEVICE: ;80;999 \<Enter\>

> The output is a report of all the keys defined on the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* test file (there is only one):

> KEY LIST -- FILE \#*662nnn* 09/26/00    PAGE 1

End of Exercise 10.1.

#### Defining the Fields in a Key

The <span id="bk85_Key_Def_option" class="anchor"></span>[Key Definition option](\l) gives you two ways to define fields in a key:

> 1\. You can enter the fields in the key in the KEY FIELDS section on the ScreenMan form, and let VA FileMan create or modify the Uniqueness Index for you. This is how you will usually define a key, and is the method you used to create Key A in Lesson 9.

> 2\. You can select a New-style Regular index as the Uniqueness Index for the key, and when prompted, instruct VA FileMan to make all the fields in the index key fields. The Uniqueness Index you select, however, must meet the following conditions:

- It must be a Regular, New-style cross-reference.
- It must be used for lookup and sorting; that is, it cannot have a name that starts with the letter "A".
- It cannot have any Set or Kill Conditions.
- It must consist of only field-type cross-reference values, all of which are used as subscripts; that is, it can contain no computed values.
- No subscripts can have transforms.

In the next three exercises you will see how the above two methods work in defining the key fields in Key A.

#### Exercise 10.2. Add DOB Field (#.03) to Primary Key A

In this exercise, you will add the DOB field to Primary Key A and have VA FileMan automatically modify the "E" Uniqueness Index to include the DOB field.

Step 1. Select VA FileMan's KEY DEFINITION option, and edit Key A.

> Select OPTION NAME: UTILITY FUNCTIONS

> Select UTILITY OPTION NAME: KEY DEFINITION

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select Subfile: \<Enter\>

> Keys defined on file \#*662nnn*:

> A PRIMARY KEY Uniqueness Index: E

> 2\) SSN (#.02)

> Choose V (Verify)/E (Edit)/D (Delete)/C (Create): EDIT

> Which Key do you wish to edit? A// \<Enter\>Step 2. You are now presented with a one-page ScreenMan form where you can edit the properties of the key.

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/050.png) | The Uniqueness Index field on the form shows you some of the information about the Uniqueness Index used by Key A; namely, the file on which the index resides, the name of the index, and the short description of the index. |

Step 3. Navigate to "Index Details…" and press Enter. A pop-up window displays more detailed information about the Uniqueness Index.

> File: *662nnn* Root File: *662nnn*

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/051.png) | On this pop-up window you can edit only some of the properties of the Uniqueness Index - the Index Name, the Short Description, the Description (wp), and the subscript Length. |

Step 4. Press \<PF1\>C to close the pop-up window. You won't make any changes to the Uniqueness Index here.

Step 5. Navigate to the third row in the "Field" column of the KEY FIELDS section. Enter DOB (or .03) to add the DOB field as a third field primary Key A. In the "Seq No." column for the DOB field, enter 3.

> Number: *nn* EDIT A KEY Page 1 of 1

Step 6. Press \<PF1\>E to exit the form and save changes.

Step 7. At this point, the Uniqueness Index "E" contains only the two fields NAME and SSN. VA FileMan notices the discrepancy between this and the fact that you specified the three fields NAME, SSN, and DOB in the "KEY FIELDS" section of the form. So, VA FileMan asks you how you want to resolve this discrepancy.

> Select option number 3, "Make Uniqueness Index match Key." This will make VA FileMan modify the definition of the Uniqueness Index so that it contains the three fields listed in the KEY FIELDS section of the form.

Step 8. If prompted to delete the old and rebuild the new index, answer YES to both questions. Press Enter again to continue.

> Do you want to delete the old index now? YES// \<Enter\>

> Removing old index ... DONE!

> Do you want to build the index now? YES// \<Enter\>

Step 9. Next, you are asked whether you want to check the integrity of the key. Since you are going to modify this key again in the next exercise, answer NO to this question.

> Do want to check the integrity of this key now? NOEnd of Exercise 10.2

#### Exercise 10.3. Make the "C" Index the Uniqueness Index for Key A

In this exercise, you will select the "C" index created in Lesson 1 as the Uniqueness Index for Key A. Then you will have VA FileMan automatically redefine the key so that the fields in that index (DOB and SSN) are the key fields.

Step 1. Select VA FileMan's KEY DEFINITION option, and edit Key A.

> Select OPTION NAME: UTILITY FUNCTIONS

> Select UTILITY OPTION NAME: KEY DEFINITION

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select Subfile: \<Enter\>

> Keys defined on file \#*662nnn*:

> A PRIMARY KEY Uniqueness Index: E

> Field(s): 1) NAME (#.01)

> 2\) SSN (#.02)

> 3\) DOB (#.03)

> Choose V (Verify)/E (Edit)/D (Delete)/C (Create): EDIT

> Which Key do you wish to edit? A// \<Enter\>Step 2. On the ScreenMan form, navigate to "Index Details…" and press Enter. Notice that as a result of Exercise 10.2, VA FileMan added the DOB field to the "E" Uniqueness Index. Press \<PF1\>C to close the pop-up window.

Step 3. Now, navigate to "Uniqueness Index" and enter C to select as the Uniqueness Index for Key A the "C" index you created in Lesson 1 of this tutorial. The "C" index is a compound index with two fields, DOB and SSN.

> Number: *nn* EDIT A KEY Page 1 of 1

> File: *662nnn* Name: A Priority: PRIMARY

> KEY FIELDS:

> ==========

> Field Seq No. File Field Name

> ----- ------- ---- ----------

> .01 1 *662nnn* NAME

> .02 2 *662nnn* SSN

> .03 3 *662nnn* DOB

> Uniqueness Index: C \<Enter\>

> This is a Regular index on the DOB and SSN fields.

> Index Details...

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/052.png) | Notice that entering "C" as the "Uniqueness Index:" property displayed a description of the index. If you'll remember, this is the Short Description you entered for the "C" index in Lesson 1 of this tutorial. |

Step 4. Press \<PF1\>E to exit the form and save changes.

Step 5. Since you changed the Uniqueness Index for Key A from "E" to "C", VA FileMan asks if you no longer need the "E" index and whether you want to delete it. Answer NO. In a later step, you will again make index "E" the Uniqueness Index for Key A.

> Do you want to delete the 'E' Uniqueness Index (#*nnn*) on File

> \#*662nnn* previously used by Key 'A' of File \#*662nnn*? NOStep 6. Now VA FileMan recognizes that the fields listed in the KEY FIELDS section of the ScreenMan form (NAME, SSN, and DOB) don't match the fields defined in the "C" index (DOB and SSN), and asks you how you want to resolve this discrepancy. This time, select option 2, "Make Key match Uniqueness Index."

> The Key fields and the fields in the Uniqueness Index don't match.

> Select one of the following:

> 1 Re-Edit the Key

> 2 Make Key match Uniqueness Index (also selected on

> up-arrow)

> 3 Make Uniqueness Index match Key

> Enter response: 2 Make Key match Uniqueness Index (also selected on

> up-arrow)

> Modifying fields in Key ... DONE!

Step 7. Answer NO when asked if you want to check the integrity of the key.

> Do want to check the integrity of this key now? NO

> Keys defined on file \#*662nnn*:

> A PRIMARY KEY Uniqueness Index: C

> Field(s): 1) DOB (#.03)

> 2\) SSN (#.02)

End of Exercise 10.3

#### Exercise 10.4. Restore Key A To Its Original Definition

In this exercise you will restore the definition of Key A so that it contains the fields NAME and SSN, and uses "E" as its Uniqueness Index.

Step 1. Select the VA FileMan's KEY DEFINITION option, and edit Key A.

> Select OPTION NAME: UTILITY FUNCTIONS

> Select UTILITY OPTION NAME: KEY DEFINITION

> MODIFY WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> Select Subfile: \<Enter\>

> Keys defined on file \#*662nnn*:

> A PRIMARY KEY Uniqueness Index: C

> Field(s): 1) DOB (#.03)

> 2\) SSN (#.02)

> Choose V (Verify)/E (Edit)/D (Delete)/C (Create): EDIT

> Which Key do you wish to edit? A// \<Enter\>Step 2. On the ScreenMan form, navigate to the second row in the "Field" column of the "KEY FIELDS" section and change the .03 to .01.

Step 3. Navigate to "Uniqueness Index" and enter E. The screen should look like this:

> Number: *nn* EDIT A KEY Page 1 of 1

> File: *662nnn* Name: A Priority: PRIMARY

> KEY FIELDS:

> Uniqueness Index for Key 'A' of File \#*662nnn*

> Index Details...

> COMMAND: Press \<PF1\>H for help Insert

Step 4. Press \<PF1\>E to exit the form and save changes.

Step 5. Answer NO when asked if you want to delete the "C" index.

> Do you want to delete the 'C' Uniqueness Index (#*nnn*) on File

> \#*662nnn* previously used by Key 'A' of File \#*662nnn*? NOStep 6. Again the KEY FIELDS (NAME and SSN) don't match the fields in the "E" Uniqueness Index (NAME, SSN, and DOB). Select option 3 to have FileMan modify the "E" index.

> The Key fields and the fields in the Uniqueness Index don't match.

> Select one of the following:

> 1 Re-Edit the Key

> 2 Make Key match Uniqueness Index (also selected on

> up-arrow)

> 3 Make Uniqueness Index match Key

> Enter response: 3 Make Uniqueness Index match Key

> Modifying fields in Key ... DONE!

Step 7. Answer YES if asked whether you want to delete the old and build the new "E" index. Press Enter to continue.

> Do you want to delete the old index now? YES// \<Enter\>

> Removing old index ... DONE!

> Do you want to build the index now? YES// \<Enter\>

> Building new index ... DONE!

Step 8. Answer YES to check key integrity. There should be no problems.

> Do want to check the integrity of this key now? YES

> Checking key integrity ... NO PROBLEMS

> Press RETURN to continue: \<Enter\>

> Keys defined on file \#*662nnn*:

>     A PRIMARY KEY Uniqueness Index: E  
>        Field(s): 1) NAME (#.01)

### Lesson 11. VA FileMan Key Integrity

<!-- back-to-toc -->[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

In this lesson, you will see examples of how VA FileMan enforces the integrity of the key you created in Lesson 9, and worked with in Lesson 10.

#### When Does VA FileMan Check Key Integrity?

VA FileMan checks the integrity of keys at the following times:

> 1. In the Key Definition option

> When you create or edit a key, VA FileMan asks if you want to check the integrity of the key. You can select to verify a key at any time. (You've already seen examples of this.)

> 2. In the <span id="bk89_Mandatory_Required_Field_Check" class="anchor"></span>[Mandatory/Required Field Check option](\l) (on VA FileMan's Utility Functions menu)

> If the field selected for checking is a key field, this option verifies that the field has a value (i.e., not null) for all records in the file.

> 3. In the [Verify Fields option](\l) (on VA FileMan's Utility Functions menu)

> If the field selected for verification is a key field, the integrity of the key(s) of which it is a part is checked.

> 4. When records are added

> All of the VA FileMan APIs and options that add records (<span id="bk91_FILE_DICN" class="anchor"></span>[FILE^DICN](\l), <span id="bk92_UPDATE_DIE" class="anchor"></span>[UPDATE^DIE](\l), the <span id="bk93_Enter_Edit_File_Entries" class="anchor"></span>[Enter or Edit File Entries](\l) option, etc.) have been modified to verify the integrity of keys as records are added to the file. By default, if the new record violates key integrity, the record is deleted.

> 5. When records are edited

> Similarly, all of the VA FileMan APIs and options that allow you to edit the value of key fields (<span id="bk94_DIE" class="anchor"></span>[^DIE](\l), <span id="bk95_FILE_DIE" class="anchor"></span>[FILE^DIE](\l), <span id="bk96_DDS" class="anchor"></span>[^DDS](\l), the Enter or Edit File Entries option, etc.) have been modified to ensure that edits don't cause key integrity to be violated.

> 6. In the Validator APIs

> [\$\$KEYVAL^DIE](\l), <span id="bk98_VAL_DIE" class="anchor"></span>[VAL^DIE](\l), and <span id="bk99_VALS_DIE" class="anchor"></span>[VALS^DIE](\l) all check the integrity of key fields.

#### The Editing APIs and Key Integrity

All of VA FileMan's editing APIs, including ^DIE and FILE^DIE, automatically enforce key integrity when you edit key fields.

^DIE checks the integrity of simple keys (i.e., one-field keys) immediately after the field is edited. It checks the integrity of compound keys (i.e., keys that are composed of more than one field) at the very end of the editing session, after all the fields in the record have been edited.

#### Exercise 11.1. Try to Delete the Value of the Key Field SSN

In this exercise, you will see how VA FileMan's Enter or Edit File Entries automatically enforces key integrity.

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Enter or Edit File Entries option to edit the NAME field and the SSN field, the two fields in the Primary Key A you created in Lesson 9.

> Select OPTION NAME: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

> INPUT TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// SSN

> THEN EDIT FIELD: \<Enter\>Step 2. Select the MODIFIED,ENTRY record and enter and at-sign (@) at the SSN field to try to delete it.

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY

> SSN: 666456789// @ ?? Required Key field

> SSN: 666456789// \<Enter\>End of Exercise 11.1

#### Exercise 11.2. Try to Create a Duplicate Key

In this exercise, you will try to change the NAME and SSN of the MODIFIED,ENTRY record to see how VA FileMan handles edits that cause duplicate keys.

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Enter or Edit File Entries option to edit the fields in Primary Key A: NAME field (#.01) and SSN field (#.02) in the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file.

> Select OPTION NAME: E \<Enter\>NTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

> INPUT TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// .01 NAME

> THEN EDIT FIELD: SSN

> THEN EDIT FIELD: \<Enter\>Step 2. Select the MODIFIED,ENTRY record and try to change the Name to FMPATIENT,FOUR and the SSN to 666223333.

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY 666456789

> NAME: MODIFIED,ENTRY// FMPATIENT,FOUR

> SSN: 666456789// 666223333

> \*\*\*\*\* NOTE \*\*\*\*\*  

> Some of the previous edits are not valid because they create one or more duplicate keys. Some fields have been restored to their pre-edited values.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/053.png) | Another record in the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* already has these exact values for NAME and SSN. VA FileMan displayed a message indicating that this would violate key integrity. In addition, VA FileMan automatically restored the values of the NAME and SSN to their pre-edited values. |

Step 3. Answer YES when asked if you want to see a list of the fields that were edited with values that violate key integrity.

> Do you want to see a list of those fields? YES// \<Enter\>

> The following field(s) have been restored to their pre-edited values:

> File: *ZZINDIVIDUAL* File (#*662nnn*)

> Key: A

> Record: 'MODIFIED,ENTRY' (#14)

> Field: NAME (#.01)

> Invalid value: FMPATIENT,FOUR

> Restored to: MODIFIED,ENTRY

> Field: SSN (#.02)

> Invalid value: 666223333

> Restored to: 666456789

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/054.png) | VA FileMan displays the record that was edited, the invalid key field values, and the original values to which the fields were restored. |

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/055.png) | This time FileMan accepted our edits. Now there are two entries in the *ZZINDIVIDUAL* file with the name FMPATIENT,FOUR, but since they have different SSNs, key integrity has not been violated. |

End of Exercise 11.2

#### The DIEFIRE Variable

You can set the variable DIEFIRE in an input template or within any of the semicolon-pieces of the DR input variable to ^DIE to instruct VA FileMan to fire the record-level indexes and check the integrity of all compound keys at that point in the template or DR string. If the integrity of any key is violated, VA FileMan sets the variable X to the string "BADKEY", which can be checked by M code in the next field in the template, or the next semicolon-piece of the DR string.

You can control what VA FileMan does if it finds any problems with the keys by setting DIEFIRE to null or any combination of the following flags:

> M = Prints an error message to user.

> L = Returns the DIEBADK array.

> R = Restores invalid key fields to their pre-edited values.

If you include the L flag in DIEFIRE and a key is invalid, VA FileMan sets the DIEBADK array, which can be checked by M code in the next field in the template, or the next semicolon-piece of the DR string. The format of the DIEBADK array is as follows:

DIEBADK(rFile#,key#,file#,IENS,field#,"O") = The original value of the field.

> DIEBADK(rFile#,key#,file#,IENS,field#,"N") = The new (invalid) value of the field.

where,

> rFile# = The root file of the Uniqueness Index of the key. This is the file or subfile number of the fields that make up the key.

> key# = The internal entry number (IEN) of the key in the KEY file.

> file# = The file of the Uniqueness Index of the key. This is the file or subfile where the Uniqueness Index resides. For whole file indexes, this is a file or subfile at a higher level than root file.

> IENS = The IENS of the record that - with the edits - would have a non-unique key.

> field# = The field number of the field being edited.

#### Exercise 11.3. Use the DIEFIRE Variable to Check Key Integrity at a Specific Point

In this lesson you will create an input template that contains the NAME and SSN fields. Immediately after the SSN field, the input template sets the DIEFIRE variable to "R" to check the integrity of Key A and restore the fields to their original values if the edits to NAME and SSN cause a duplicate key. If edits result in a duplicate key, the input template sets Y to jump back to the NAME field, so that the user can try entering values for NAME and SSN again.

Step 1. Use VA FileMan's Enter or Edit File Entries option to create an input template called *ZZINDIVIDUAL*.

> Select OPTION NAME: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

> INPUT TO WHAT FILE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*// \<Enter\>

> EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// @1

> THEN EDIT FIELD: .01 \<Enter\> NAME

> THEN EDIT FIELD: .02 \<Enter\> SSN

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/056.png) | The @1, which is entered as the first field, serves as a label to which we return if a duplicate key would be created with the user's new NAME and SSN values. |

Step 2. Enter as the next field code to set DIEFIRE to an R.

> THEN EDIT FIELD: S DIEFIRE="R"

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/057.png) | This tells VA FileMan to fire the compound (record-level) cross-references and to validate any keys at this point. The "R" tells FileMan to restore the NAME and SSN to their pre-edited values if the user-supplied values resulted in a duplicate key. |

Step 3. Enter the following as the next field in the template.

> THEN EDIT FIELD: I X="BADKEY" W !!,"An entry already exists

> with that NAME and SSN. Please try again.",! S Y="@1"

> THEN EDIT FIELD: \<Enter\>

| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/058.png) | Here, immediately after the code that sets DIEFIRE, we check the variable X to see if it is set to "BADKEY". If so, the new NAME and SSN caused a duplicate, so we print a message to the user and branch back to label @1 in the template to prompt for NAME and SSN again. |

Step 4. Save the input template as *ZZINDIVIDUAL*.

> STORE THESE FIELDS IN TEMPLATE: *ZZINDIVIDUAL*

> Are you adding '*ZZINDIVIDUAL*' as a new INPUT TEMPLATE? No//

> Y \<Enter\> (Yes)

Step 5. Select the FMPATIENT,FOUR entry with SSN 666456789.

> Select *ZZINDIVIDUAL* NAME: LAKE

> 1 FMPATIENT,FOUR 666223333

> 2 FMPATIENT,FOUR 666456789

> CHOOSE 1-2: 2 \<Enter\> FMPATIENT,FOUR 666456789

Step 6. Try to change the SSN to 666223333.

> NAME: FMPATIENT,FOUR// \<Enter\>

> SSN: 666456789// 666223333

> An entry already exists with that NAME and SSN. Please try

> again.

Step 7. FileMan now branches us back to the NAME field in our input template. This time enter MODIFIED,ENTRY for NAME and accept the default SSN.

> NAME: FMPATIENT,FOUR// MODIFIED,ENTRY

> SSN: 666456789// \<Enter\>

|                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](fm-key-and-index-tutorial/059.png) | This time, no messages are printed, since this new NAME-SSN combination is not a duplicate. FileMan does not branch you back to NAME, and you exit the template. |

<p>For example, a whole-file index containing fields from the EMAIL multiple can be stored at the top level of the file, and allows you to lookup records in the <em>ZZINDIVIDUAL</em> file based on field values within that multiple.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>X(1), X(2)</td>
<td><p>These lines shows information about the cross-reference values. Every cross-reference value must have a unique order number. X(1) corresponds to the cross-reference value with order number 1; X(2) corresponds to the cross-reference value with order number 2.<br />
<br />
X(1) in this case is the value of the DOB field (file #<em>662</em>100, field #.03), which is stored in the first subscript (Subscr 1) after "C" in the index. The forwards designation indicates that lookups will traverse this subscript in a forwards direction. (This is the Collation property of a subscript, and will be discussed further in Lesson 3).<br />
<br />
The subscript number for a cross-reference value need not equal the order number. In fact there may be times when you'd create a cross-reference value that has no subscript number. In that case, even though the value isn't stored in the index, you can still refer to it via X(order#) in the cross-reference logiC. (You'll see an example of this in Lesson 5.)</p>
